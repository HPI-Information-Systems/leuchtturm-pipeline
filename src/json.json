And both\r\ntechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have\r\nbeen violated regardless of where the fututes are.\r\n\r\nWhat most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long\r\nas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human\r\nintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did \"today\" but\r\nwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 \"Single Stock futures\" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r\none of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will\r\nhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r\ncomputer based with there own trading programs.\r\n\r\nAgain for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r\ncontract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.\r\n\r\nCBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited\r\nStake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001\r\n\r\n - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The\r\nChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following\r\napproval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed\r\ninto law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. \"Today's\r\nannouncement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges,\" said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. \"This exciting new\r\ninitiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives\r\ntrading and risk management.\" \"The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r\nsingle-stock futures,\" said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. \"Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r\nexchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products.\" \"I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs\r\nand our members' concerns,\" said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. \"We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r\ngreat benefit to our members.\" \"Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r\nconnectivity of the futures and securities worlds,\" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. \"This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r\nefficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options.\" \"The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new\r\nproduct to our markets,\" said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. \"The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important\r\ncontributions to the success of this venture.\" The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated\r\nexchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r\nsystem. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty\r\nsaid the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate\r\ncontracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r\nselection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r\ncorporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board\r\nOptions Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r\nindexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options\r\nmarketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on\r\nindexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50Ô , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini\r\nS&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.\r\nOn November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by\r\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone who would like to chat in more detail on our CTA managed accts please dont hesitate to call me at toll free (800) 773-1713\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nJerry Jacobs\r\nC.T.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF ANYONE WHO DID NOT GET THE \"PDF\" FILE ATTACHMENT SHOWING THE TWO AND ONE\r\nHALF YEAR LONG TERM NUMBERS AND FULL CFTC DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT PLEASE E-MAIL\r\nOR CALL TOLL FREE (800) 773-1713 AND WE WILL RESEND IT RIGHT AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\r\n\r\nTHE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN\r\nCONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR\r\nBROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN\r\nFUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.

THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A \"LIMIT MOVE\".  THE PLACEMENT OF\r\nCONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A \"STOP-LOSS\" OR \"STOP-LIMIT\" ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS\r\nMAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.\r\n\r\nA \"SPREAD\" POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE \"LONG\" OR \"SHORT\" POSITION.  THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS\r\nWELL AS FOR YOU.  THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.\r\n\r\nIN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES.  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES\r\nTO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFIT TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.

And both\r\ntechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have\r\nbeen violated regardless of where the fututes are.\r\n\r\nWhat most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long\r\nas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human\r\nintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did \"today\" but\r\nwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 \"Single Stock futures\" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r\none of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will\r\nhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r\ncomputer based with there own trading programs.\r\n\r\nAgain for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r\ncontract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.\r\n\r\nCBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited\r\nStake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001\r\n\r\n - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The\r\nChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following\r\napproval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed\r\ninto law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. \"Today's\r\nannouncement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges,\" said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. \"This exciting new\r\ninitiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives\r\ntrading and risk management.\" \"The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r\nsingle-stock futures,\" said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. \"Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r\nexchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products.\" \"I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs\r\nand our members' concerns,\" said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. \"We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r\ngreat benefit to our members.\" \"Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r\nconnectivity of the futures and securities worlds,\" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. \"This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r\nefficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options.\" \"The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new\r\nproduct to our markets,\" said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. \"The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important\r\ncontributions to the success of this venture.\" The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated\r\nexchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r\nsystem. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty\r\nsaid the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate\r\ncontracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r\nselection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r\ncorporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board\r\nOptions Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r\nindexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options\r\nmarketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on\r\nindexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50Ô , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini\r\nS&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.\r\nOn November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by\r\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone who would like to chat in more detail on our CTA managed accts please dont hesitate to call me at toll free (800) 773-1713\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nJerry Jacobs\r\nC.T.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF ANYONE WHO DID NOT GET THE \"PDF\" FILE ATTACHMENT SHOWING THE TWO AND ONE\r\nHALF YEAR LONG TERM NUMBERS AND FULL CFTC DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT PLEASE E-MAIL\r\nOR CALL TOLL FREE (800) 773-1713 AND WE WILL RESEND IT RIGHT AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\r\n\r\nTHE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL.

clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market And bothtechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes havebeen violated regardless of where the fututes are What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity s and futures have there own platforms and there own systems Its been proven that as longas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year Humanintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did today butwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame This is the secret for long term success On the E mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8 21 2001 Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will beone of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms willhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12 21 2001 As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are allcomputer based with there own trading programs Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in acontract And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year For more details on this market see details below CBOE Create Joint Venture on

as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year Human\r intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did today but\r whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame This is the secret for long term success \r On the E mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8 21 2001 Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms will\r have access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12 21 2001 As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good \r For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r computer based with there own trading programs \r Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r contract And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year For more details on this market see details below \r CBOE Create Joint Venture on Single Stock Futures World s Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited\r Stake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001\r The world s largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U S are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product single stock futures contracts The\r Chicago Board Options Exchange CBOE and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc CME today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single stock futures, following\r approval by the boards of directors of both exchanges The Chicago Board of Trade CBOT has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake Legislation signed\r into law in December will allow the introduction of single stock futures by U S financial exchanges later this year, after an 18 year prohibition on the products Today s\r announcement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago s exchanges, said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky This exciting new\r initiative combines the best of securities and futures trading Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world s center in derivatives\r trading and risk management The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r single stock futures, said CME Chairman Scott Gordon Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r exchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products I am enthused that Chicago s exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers needs\r and our members concerns, said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r great benefit to our members Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r connectivity of the futures and securities worlds, said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r efficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new\r product to our markets, said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important\r contributions to the success of this venture The joint venture will be a for profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated\r exchange Single stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME s GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r system CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation OCC , which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products McNulty\r said the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC The exchanges anticipate\r contracting with Designated Primary Market Makers DPMs in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r selection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements Single stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r corporate hedging activities CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange for physicals EFPs The Chicago Board\r Options Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982 Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r indexes, such as the S P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq 100, and the S P 100 It remains the world s largest and most successful options\r marketplace Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S P 500 in 1982 Today, CME trades futures and futures options on\r indexes including the S P 500, Nasdaq 100, S P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e 50Ô , S P BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E mini\r S P 500 and E mini Nasdaq 100 contracts the fastest growing products in the exchange s history CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products \r On November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for profit, shareholder owned corporation CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC CME is regulated by\r the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites www cboe com and www cme com \r If anyone who would like to chat in more detail on our CTA managed accts please dont hesitate to call me at

This is the finding of the May CIO\r\nMagazine Tech Poll. Last summer, I partnered with the good folks at the\r\nmagazine to conduct a web-based poll of chief information officers to assess\r\nthe outlook for information technology (IT) spending on a monthly basis. The\r\nresulting \"CIO Magazine Tech Poll in partnership with yardeni.com\" is\r\nalready proving to be an accurate measure of technology spending and\r\nbusiness trends. In May, our panel predicted IT budgets will grow by just 4%\r\nover the next 12 months, down from a 7% prediction in April and down sharply\r\nfrom 19% last November. The panel reported IT budgets grew an average 5%\r\nover the previous 12 months, down from the 10% April estimate, and again\r\ndown sharply from 22% last September.\r\n\r\nNow we know: High-Tech spending is not recession proof. Like the low-tech\r\nvariety of capital spending, it depends on profits and financing conditions.\r\nIt will rebound when these two conditions improve. Since February, we've\r\nasked our CIO panelists what is the number one negative for IT spending. In\r\nMay, \"weak profits\" was cited by 37% of the panelists as the primary\r\nnegative factor facing IT spending plans in 2001. That is up from 30.8% in\r\nFebruary. In May, another 26% saw \"tight financial conditions\" as the main\r\nproblem, down from 35% in February. The Fed's aggressive easing has had an\r\nimpact on our panelists' perceptions of credit conditions since fewer are\r\nreporting that this is a number one problem for IT spending. At the same\r\ntime, more of our respondents say that weak profits are depressing\r\ntechnology budgets.\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBERS: For more on the poll and tech capital spending see my latest\r\nGLOBAL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY. In last week's GPS, I examined the valuation\r\nquestion. The mean (and not market-cap-weighted) P/E for the S&P 500 is down\r\nfrom a record high of 31 last year in March to 26 now. Stocks are cheaper,\r\nbut certainly not cheap. The median P/E for the S&P 500 actually rose over\r\nthis period from 16 to 19. S&P 500 technology stocks are also cheaper, but\r\nnot cheap. The mean tech P/E is now  down from 89, while the median is down\r\nto 35 from 58.\r\n\r\nDespite the Tech Wreck, technology stocks remain the most highly priced in\r\nthe market with a market-cap weighted P/E of 33. That is down from a high of\r\n47 early last year. Transportation valuations remain in the bargain\r\nbasement. Makes sense, right? Technology earnings grow faster than\r\nTransportation earnings so they deserve a higher P/E. Yet, when we actually\r\ncompare the performance of the two since 1990, the fact is that\r\nTransportation has outperformed Technology!\r\n\r\nPUBLIC: Laszlo Birinyi, my friend and one of the best technical market\r\nanalysts in the world, will be my special guest on Monday's Weekly Audio\r\nForum. The live event is open only to accounts with passcodes, but the\r\nrebroadcast will be public. The June EARNINGS MONTH, with \"Squiggles\r\n Inside,\" will be posted on Monday afternoon.\r\n\r\nDr. Ed\r\n\r\n********************\r\n1) You can now automatically add/delete this update and other products.

The above is a weekly chart.  Although no\r\ndoubt that KKD is in a powerful uptrend, it is simply overbought on\r\nmultiple time frames.  As you can see, the weekly bar closed with a\r\nJapanese \"hanging man,\" a short-term reversal signal after an extended\r\nrun.  Last Friday's bar was a huge bearish engulfing bar, also suggesting\r\nlower prices.  The daily OBV, RSI, CCI, MADC Histogram, stochastics, money\r\nflow, and price volume trend are all overbought and rolling over.  The red\r\nrising trend line gives a target between 62-63, just above the 38.2%\r\nFibonacci retracement shows from the low on the week of 4/6.  this is alto\r\nwhere a prior overbought reversal area failed; however, the \"measured\r\nmove\" from that failure has been satisfied with last week's gains.  The\r\nmost recent runup was partially due to short covering.  KKD had\r\napproximately 28 millinon shares outstanding after the march split,\r\nalthough only 11.5 million were eligible for trading.  By the end of\r\nApril, another 14.8 million shares were released from lock up.  As of\r\nmid-May, short interest had fallen to 5.9 million shares from a peak of\r\n9.9 million in mid-March.  Those shorts undoubtedly felt great pain, but\r\nthe technicals are suggesting that the buying euphoria is coming to an\r\nend.

What they've\r\nbeen telling me I'm still having a hard time digesting. We\r\nhave been led to believe that the only way to get to space\r\nis to spend billions of dollars doing so, and furthermore\r\nthat it is an environment in which you and I have no\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThese two tenets ignore both psychology and economics. The\r\nDennis Tito incident shows that NASA fundamentally\r\nmisunderstands the draw and the power of putting real people\r\ninto space, as well as the entrepreneurial (risk-taking)\r\nspirit these people have. And it does not cost billions to\r\nget into space. Millions, perhaps, but this may be low\r\nenough to make space tourism viable.\r\n\r\nThis is what XCOR Aerospace president Jeff Greason believes.\r\nXCOR is developing low-cost rocket engines for suborbital\r\nand low-earth-orbit manned vehicles. Amazingly, the company\r\nis already in its third generation of development, it has\r\nrevenues, and it's gotten there on angel funding of only\r\n$300,000.\r\n\r\nThere are people who want to ride spaceships, and there are\r\npeople who want to build them. And this market may have\r\nbigger revenues, and smaller expenses, than most people\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Rafe Needleman, rafe-needleman@redherring.com\r\n  Editor, http://www.redherring.com\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPANIES\r\n* XCOR Aerospace\r\n  http://www.xcor.com\r\n\r\n* Microcosm\r\n  http://www.smad.com\r\n\r\n* SpaceDev\r\n  http://www.spacedev.com\r\n\r\n* AeroAstro\r\n  http://www.aeroastro.com\r\n\r\n* Aerojet\r\n  http://www.aerojet.com\r\n\r\n* Pratt & Whitney\r\n  http://www.pratt-whitney.com\r\n\r\n* Boeing\r\n  http://www.boeing.com\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATED STORIES\r\n* Broadband wings it\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/story_redirect.asp?layout=story_generic&doc_id=RH1980015598&channel=50000005\r\n\r\n* Satellites recharge for another revolution\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=50000005&doc_id=1960015596\r\n\r\n* Catch of the Day: New material\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/story_redirect.asp?layout=story_generic&doc_id=RH1910018591&channel=80000008\r\n\r\n* Catch of the Day: Air fare\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/story_redirect.asp?layout=story_generic&doc_id=RH1830017983&channel=80000008\r\n\r\n* In satellites, Hughes is still the boss\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/story_redirect.asp?layout=story_generic&doc_id=RH1990015599&channel=50000005\r\n\r\n* Catch of the Day: Spying on the spy plane\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/story_redirect.asp?layout=story_generic&doc_id=RH230019023&channel=80000008\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n               A D V E R T I S E M E N T\r\n\r\nFind out how Oracle's Global CRM in 90 Days saves you money,\r\ntime, and resources.

If you \r\nwould like to be removed from our list, reply to this email with remove \r\nin the subject line. Thank you!\r\n June 4th, 2001\r\n RealTimeTraders.com offers free real-time stock alerts throughout the \r\nday. Why pay for chat rooms and stock pickers for old news?\r\nMorning Watch List\r\nThis section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days. \r\nClick here for this morning's Watch List Stocks: http://www.realtimetraders.com/marketinfo/watchlist.asp Beyond The Numbers\r\nWhat is the true status of the economy?\r\nLatest economic reports have been somewhat mixed and confusing.  \r\nHowever, it is very clear the markets have very little tolerance to any \r\nnegative news. Friday morning markets declined in the early going after \r\nthe markets received news that the manufacturing sector may be heading \r\ntowards a recession. But, later in the session good old General Motors \r\nrescued the markets with its latest sales data. GM said sales are ahead \r\nof expectations and the company expects to deliver earnings in line with \r\npreviously stated expectations of $4.25 for the full year 2001 and $1.05 for \r\nthe second quarter.\r\nWhile the Dow component's sales data is favorable for the markets, \r\nRealTimeTraders analysts point out the sales for the month May is \r\nmisleading because GM' truck sales were up 10%, but car sales were \r\ndown 9%. Analysts believe the sharp jump in the truck sales could be \r\ndue to problems surrounding Ford Motors. According to Ford Motor \r\nCompany, sales for both truck and car sales have declined sharply.\r\nOn a positive note, analysts pointed out the fact employment data showed \r\nsome improvement is a positive for the overall market. Which suggests the \r\nFederal Reserve's efforts to stimulate the economy may be starting to take \r\neffect. As we stated in last Thursday's market analysis, we expect this \r\nquarter's earnings warnings and job cut announcements to be below last \r\nquarter. One other important fact that is worth noting is that the Federal \r\nReserve seems to still indicate there will be more rates cuts ahead to \r\nfurther stimulate the economy.\r\nStocks to watch \r\nShares of Cisco have been steadily declining in the past few sessions, and \r\naccelerated to the downside going into theclose Friday after the company's \r\nrecent 10Q filing said it does not see any improvement in capital spending in \r\nthe foreseeable future due to the continued economic slowdown. Cisco \r\nSystems finished Friday's session lower by 41 cents and closed at $18.85, \r\nwhich puts the week's net loss at 14.5%.\r\nSector Analysis\r\nSemiconductor sector may stay rangebound\r\nIn the last two sessions we have seem the semiconductor index and \r\nsemiconductor related stocks rebound after finding some support. However, \r\nwe like to caution our readers that we do not expect this sector to move \r\nhigher until we start to see some signs of sequential growth. Despite all the \r\nupgrades and positive comments from some of the leading brokerage firms, \r\nwe continue to believe its is more prudent to focus on the company \r\nfundamentals than the so-called analysts ratings. Those who have been \r\nfollowing the semiconductor sector may recall that most of the companies in \r\nthis sector have continue to make negative comments about their near-term \r\nearnings outlook. Given that the semiconductor index has some support \r\naround the current level, it can be expected the sector may trade in a range \r\nuntil we receive further news from some of the bellwether stocks. Note that \r\nIntel is expected to give its mid quarter update during this week. We believe \r\nIntel's update would definitely impact the sector as a whole. We will continue \r\nto monitor the markets and alert our readers to any significant news that may \r\nimpact the markets in our breaking news section.  \r\nEconomic Reports & Bond Markets\r\nFriday the bond market almost gained another full point and closed near the \r\nhighs of the day. Given that this week markets will have very little in terms of \r\neconomic data and the fact the bonds gained almost 2 points in the past two \r\nsession might lead to some range bound trading or a pull back. Monday the \r\nChallenger Layoff figures will be released at 10AM. \r\nMarket Breadth \r\nFriday's NYSE advance/decline reading was 1810/1236 Vs. \r\nThursday's reading of1822/1236\r\nFriday's Nasdaq advance/decline reading was 2166/1598 Vs. \r\nThursday's reading of 2258/1591\r\nNew Highs and New Lows\r\nFriday's NYSE new high/lows was 104/23 Vs. Thursday's\r\nreading of 110/22\r\nFriday's Nasdaq new high/lows was 132/44 Vs.

status of the economy \r Latest economic reports have been somewhat mixed and confusing \r However, it is very clear the markets have very little tolerance to any \r negative news Friday morning markets declined in the early going after \r the markets received news that the manufacturing sector may be heading \r towards a recession But, later in the session good old General Motors \r rescued the markets with its latest sales data GM said sales are ahead \r of expectations and the company expects to deliver earnings in line with \r previously stated expectations of 4 25 for the full year 2001 and 1 05 for \r the second quarter \r While the Dow component s sales data is favorable for the markets, \r RealTimeTraders analysts point out the sales for the month May is \r misleading because GM truck sales were up 10 , but car sales were \r down 9 Analysts believe the sharp jump in the truck sales could be \r due to problems surrounding Ford Motors According to Ford Motor \r Company, sales for both truck and car sales have declined sharply \r On a positive note, analysts pointed out the fact employment data showed \r some improvement is a positive for the overall market Which suggests the \r Federal Reserve s efforts to stimulate the economy may be starting to take \r effect As we stated in last Thursday s market analysis, we expect this \r quarter s earnings warnings and job cut announcements to be below last \r quarter One other important fact that is worth noting is that the Federal \r Reserve seems to still indicate there will be more rates cuts ahead to \r further stimulate the economy \r Stocks to watch \r Shares of Cisco have been steadily declining in the past few sessions, and \r accelerated to the downside going into theclose Friday after the company s \r recent 10Q filing said it does not see any improvement in capital spending in \r the foreseeable future due to the continued economic slowdown Cisco \r Systems finished Friday s session lower by 41 cents and closed at 18 85, \r which puts the week s net loss at 14 5 \r Sector Analysis\r Semiconductor sector may stay rangebound\r In the last two sessions we have seem the semiconductor index and \r semiconductor related stocks rebound after finding some support However, \r we like to caution our readers that we do not expect this sector to move \r higher until we start to see some signs of sequential growth Despite all the \r upgrades and positive comments from some of the leading brokerage firms, \r we continue to believe its is more prudent to focus on the company \r fundamentals than the so called analysts ratings Those who have been \r following the semiconductor sector may recall that most of the companies in \r this sector have continue to make negative comments about their near term \r earnings outlook Given that the semiconductor index has some support \r around the current level, it can be expected the sector may trade in a range \r until we receive further news from some of the bellwether stocks Note that \r Intel is expected to give its mid quarter update during this week We believe \r Intel s update would definitely impact the sector as a whole We will continue \r to monitor the markets and alert our readers to any significant news that may \r impact the markets in our breaking news section \r Economic Reports Bond Markets\r Friday the bond market almost gained another full point and closed near the \r highs of the day Given that this week markets will have very little in terms of \r economic data and the fact the bonds gained almost 2 points in the

Consumer Reports and Yahoo! Sign Premium Content Distribution Agreement\u001dYahoo! Shopping Unveils Pay-Per-View Product Ratings and Free Buying Guides from Consumer Reports(R) Consumer Reports Auto Buying Guides Available for Free at Yahoo! Autos   SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading enabler of Web transactions, and Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports(R) magazine and ConsumerReports.org, today announced a premium content distribution agreement to distribute Consumer Reports(R) unbiased and objective product ratings and buying guides on the Yahoo! network. As part of the agreement, Yahoo! has integrated free buying guides and premium pay-per-view product ratings from Consumer Reports into Yahoo!(R) Shopping (http://shopping.yahoo.com). Additionally, Yahoo! has integrated free Consumer Reports auto buying guides into Yahoo! Autos (http://autos.yahoo.com), marking the first time this content is available outside ConsumerReports.org. Yahoo! also will work with Consumer Reports (www.ConsumerReports.org) to integrate buying guides into other relevant areas of the Yahoo! network. Under the terms of the agreement, Yahoo! will receive an undisclosed share of revenue from sales of pay-per-view content on its site.   \"Our research shows that consumers demand trusted information and resources to help them make well-informed buying decisions,\" said Rob Solomon, vice president and general manager of Yahoo! Shopping. \"Consumer Reports has established itself as one of the most popular and trusted fee-based sites on the Web, and we are happy to offer their content to our large audience of shoppers.\"   Available today, shoppers can view free Consumer Reports buying guides on both Yahoo! Shopping and Yahoo! Autos. The free guides contain general summaries of product categories, buying advice and information including product trends. Consumers also have the option to buy pay-per-view product reports for only $2.95 per report, which includes access to the report for 30 days on Yahoo! Shopping. Each pay-per-view report provides in-depth buying advice, performance ratings and information about key features and brand reliability on all the rated products in a category, similar to the information in Consumer Reports magazine. During the 30-day period, users will have access to dynamic information as it is updated by Consumer Reports. Consumers can conveniently purchase these premium reports using Yahoo! Wallet, the most widely accepted wallet on the Web.   \"This business relationship with Yahoo! enables Consumer Reports to reach one of the largest purchasing audiences on the Web,\" said John Sateja, vice president of New Media at Consumers Union. \"This relationship also gives Consumer Reports the ability to extend our brand online, and develop new relationships with consumers in addition to the more than 560,000 online subscribers we currently serve at our Web site -- ConsumerReports.org.\"   Making Better Buying Decisions  Consumer Reports has the most comprehensive auto-test program of any consumer publication in the United States. Unlike other publications and Web sites, the magazine buys all the cars, trucks, and SUVs that it tests in the retail market and typically evaluates the vehicles for several months. Experienced auto engineers conduct 46 individual tests, ranging from emergency handling, acceleration, and braking, to fuel economy and bumper-impact tests. Yahoo! Autos users can access Consumer Reports content on the best new and used cars of 2001, as well as reports on which used cars are the safest, how to inspect a used car and warranty comparison information. Yahoo! Autos will continue to expand current offerings to include Consumer Reports pay-per-view content in the near future.   Yahoo! Shopping has integrated links to Consumer Reports content within relevant areas of the site, so consumers can easily access guides and reports on products as they shop. In addition, Yahoo! has created a centralized location where shoppers can peruse buying guides and premium product reports by category (http://shopping.yahoo.com/consumerreports). The addition of Consumer Reports content complements Yahoo! Shopping's existing features and programs designed to help consumers make better-informed purchases online.

TI Extends Wireless LAN Coverage Area By 70 Percent With New IEEE 802.11b Chip and Reference Designs   DALLAS, Jun 4, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Answering market demands for better performing and more highly integrated IEEE 802.11b consumer products, Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today announced a new wireless LAN chip which will be available for use in reference designs for PC card, mini-PCI and USB applications. Increasing the deployment of Wi-Fi(TM) technology in broadband homes and offices, TI's new chip increases WLAN coverage area by 70 percent versus competitive solutions in real life environments, the result of a 30 percent linear reach improvement. This reach/area improvement is vital for the growth of the home user market since it means consumers only need to purchase one access point or gateway to cover their entire home. (See: http://www.ti.com/sc/wirelessethernet ).   The new chip, the ACX100, is comprised of an integrated Media Access Controller (MAC) and baseband processor, combined with on-chip PCI, CardBus and USB interfaces, thus eliminating the need for external bridging components. The chip supports both the CCK (Complementary Code Keying) and newer Packet Binary Convolutional Code(TM) of the current IEEE 802.11b standard. With PBCC(TM) modulation, end-to-end solutions using TI's ACX100 offer a coding gain advantage of 3dB over current CCK-only 802.11b solutions, allowing for the 70 percent coverage area improvement.   Since it utilizes an embedded microprocessor for implementing much of the MAC layer protocol, the ACX100 is firmware upgradable, which facilitates support of evolving IEEE standards such as the forthcoming 802.11e (quality of service) and 802.11i (security enhancements). The device is fully compatible with the IEEE 802.11b standard and also supports a 22Mbit/sec high rate mode that doubles the throughput over today's existing 802.11b networks.   \"By offering cost optimized reference designs and a new generation technology that can enable a sub $80 retail price for better performing PC cards, TI's ACX100 will help increase wireless LAN penetration in homes and offices,\" said Allen Nogee, senior analyst at Cahners In-Stat Group. \"The extended range achievable by the ACX100 will also impact the growth of wireless networking in the home environment since consumers will now be able to easily experience broadband Internet sharing through a single access point, which has not been always the case today.\"   Complete Reference Designs Speed Time to Market   To help manufacturers achieve a faster time to market, TI is offering three reference designs using the ACX100 for PC Card, mini-PCI and USB applications. The reference designs include a complete hardware development kit (HDK), which reduces engineering resource requirements by providing schematics, layout, Gerber files and bill of material requirements. These same reference designs also support the 22Mbit/sec high rate extension.   Network driver interface specification (NDIS) 4/5 drivers, including configuration and site survey tools, that are Microsoft(R) Windows(R) Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) certified are also included. TI expects to take each reference design through WECA certification of Wi-Fi interoperability to further improve time-to-market for customers. To prepare for the fall arrival of Windows XP, TI is also developing NDIS 5.1 drivers required for this platform. WHQL certified Windows XP drivers for the ACX100 are scheduled to be available by 4Q01.   The ACX100 was also designed with considerations for access point development. Leveraging a 32-bit PCI/CardBus or 16-bit slave interface, the ACX100 can easily connect to a network processor to provide a highly effective solution for access points. TI has created an ACX100 driver development kit (DDK) offering an easy way for developers to create customized drivers often required for access point applications.   \"TI strongly believes that 802.11 will reshape the Local Area Networking landscape,\" said Marc Cetto, general manager of TI's Home Networking Business Unit. \"With our new ACX100 solution we will be able to drive wireless networking into more broadband homes, offices and public places by offering a solution with extended reach and range at the right price point for more consumers to adopt the technology. We will continue adding technology enhancements while targeting system cost discontinuities for all our forthcoming wireless LAN products \"   Availability   ACX100 based reference designs are available today. Production shipments of customers' systems based upon the ACX100 are expected in 4Q01.   About TI Broadband   For OEM's developing broadband communications solutions, only TI's advanced signal processing-based silicon and software platforms deliver the optimal performance, lower power consumption, and system level integration required to rapidly deploy differentiated next generation products for cable modems, digital subscriber line (xDSL) modems, integrated access devices (IADs), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) gateways, carrier infrastructure, and home and office wireless networking.

Designs DALLAS, Jun 4, 2001 PRNewswire via COMTEX Answering market demands for better performing and more highly integrated IEEE 802 11b consumer products, Texas Instruments Incorporated TI NYSE TXN today announced a new wireless LAN chip which will be available for use in reference designs for PC card, mini PCI and USB applications Increasing the deployment of Wi Fi TM technology in broadband homes and offices, TI s new chip increases WLAN coverage area by 70 percent versus competitive solutions in real life environments, the result of a 30 percent linear reach improvement This reach area improvement is vital for the growth of the home user market since it means consumers only need to purchase one access point or gateway to cover their entire home See http www ti com sc wirelessethernet The new chip, the ACX100, is comprised of an integrated Media Access Controller MAC and baseband processor, combined with on chip PCI, CardBus and USB interfaces, thus eliminating the need for external bridging components The chip supports both the CCK Complementary Code Keying and newer Packet Binary Convolutional Code TM of the current IEEE 802 11b standard With PBCC TM modulation, end to end solutions using TI s ACX100 offer a coding gain advantage of 3dB over current CCK only 802 11b solutions, allowing for the 70 percent coverage area improvement Since it utilizes an embedded microprocessor for implementing much of the MAC layer protocol, the ACX100 is firmware upgradable, which facilitates support of evolving IEEE standards such as the forthcoming 802 11e quality of service and 802 11i security enhancements The device is fully compatible with the IEEE 802 11b standard and also supports a 22Mbit sec high rate mode that doubles the throughput over today s existing 802 11b networks By offering cost optimized reference designs and a new generation technology that can enable a sub 80 retail price for better performing PC cards, TI s ACX100 will help increase wireless LAN penetration in homes and offices, said Allen Nogee, senior analyst at Cahners In Stat Group The extended range achievable by the ACX100 will also impact the growth of wireless networking in the home environment since consumers will now be able to easily experience broadband Internet sharing through a single access point, which has not been always the case today Complete Reference Designs Speed Time to Market To help manufacturers achieve a faster time to market, TI is offering three reference designs using the ACX100 for PC Card, mini PCI and USB applications The reference designs include a complete hardware development kit HDK , which reduces engineering resource requirements by providing schematics, layout, Gerber files and bill of material requirements These same reference designs also support the 22Mbit sec high rate extension Network driver interface specification NDIS 4 5 drivers, including configuration and site survey tools, that are Microsoft R Windows R Hardware Quality Labs WHQL certified are also included TI expects to take each reference design through WECA certification of Wi Fi interoperability to further improve time to market for customers To prepare for the fall arrival of Windows XP, TI is also developing NDIS 5 1 drivers required for this platform WHQL certified Windows XP drivers for the ACX100 are scheduled to be available by 4Q01 The ACX100 was also designed with considerations for access point development Leveraging a 32 bit PCI CardBus or 16 bit slave interface, the ACX100 can easily connect to a network processor to provide a highly effective solution for access points TI has created an ACX100 driver development kit DDK offering an easy way for developers to create customized drivers often required for access point applications TI strongly believes that 802 11 will reshape the Local Area Networking landscape, said Marc Cetto, general manager of TI s Home Networking Business Unit With our new ACX100 solution we will be able to drive wireless networking into more broadband homes, offices and public places by offering a solution with extended reach and range at the right price point for more

QUALCOMM Prevails in Three Stock Option Cases   SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), today announced favorable decisions in three cases that had been brought by former employees claiming rights to unearned QUALCOMM stock options. In the Hanig v. QUALCOMM case, the California Superior Court granted summary judgment in QUALCOMM's favor on all of plaintiffs' claims on the grounds that the releases and agreements not to sue executed by each of the plaintiffs barred their lawsuit. The plaintiffs had signed the releases in exchange for the right to participate in a bonus retention plan under which QUALCOMM paid millions of dollars to its former workers who became employees of Ericsson when QUALCOMM sold its infrastructure equipment business. The case was filed by 69 of those former employees.   In addition, QUALCOMM announced that the plaintiffs in the May v. QUALCOMM case have agreed to dismiss with prejudice their purported class action lawsuit against QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM Personal Electronics, in which several claims seeking compensation for stock options and bonus payments had been alleged by a separate group of former employees. The plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their claims after the court granted QUALCOMM's motion dismiss their second amended complaint.   Finally, QUALCOMM announced that the United States District Court for the Southern District of California had granted summary judgment on seventeen of eighteen causes of action in a purported class action lawsuit arising out of the reduction in force which occurred at the Company in February of 1999. In that case, the purported class representatives had each sought vesting of stock options after the termination of their employment, even though each had executed releases of claims in exchange for generous severance payments offered as part of the separation package. In granting judgment in QUALCOMM's favor on those claims, the Court upheld the validity of those releases.   \"We are pleased that the Company has been completely vindicated in the Hanig and May cases and that virtually all of the claims in the third case have been summarily dismissed,\" said Louis M. Lupin, senior vice president and general counsel for QUALCOMM. \"QUALCOMM works very hard to ensure that our employees are treated not only lawfully, but fairly, and has consistently gone far beyond what the Company was legally required to do in providing for our employees and our former employees. Consequently, it is very disappointing when frivolous claims such as the ones raised in these cases are made but gratifying when their lack of merit is recognized. We will continue to vigorously defend against meritless claims such as these.\"   QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on the Company's CDMA digital technology.

QUALCOMM Prevails in Three Stock Option Cases SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 BUSINESS WIRE QUALCOMM Incorporated Nasdaq QCOM , today announced favorable decisions in three cases that had been brought by former employees claiming rights to unearned QUALCOMM stock options In the Hanig v QUALCOMM case, the California Superior Court granted summary judgment in QUALCOMM s favor on all of plaintiffs claims on the grounds that the releases and agreements not to sue executed by each of the plaintiffs barred their lawsuit The plaintiffs had signed the releases in exchange for the right to participate in a bonus retention plan under which QUALCOMM paid millions of dollars to its former workers who became employees of Ericsson when QUALCOMM sold its infrastructure equipment business The case was filed by 69 of those former employees In addition, QUALCOMM announced that the plaintiffs in the May v QUALCOMM case have agreed to dismiss with prejudice their purported class action lawsuit against QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM Personal Electronics, in which several claims seeking compensation for stock options and bonus payments had been alleged by a separate group of former employees The plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their claims after the court granted QUALCOMM s motion dismiss their second amended complaint Finally, QUALCOMM announced that the United States District Court for the Southern District of California had granted summary judgment on seventeen of eighteen causes of action in a purported class action lawsuit arising out of the reduction in force which occurred at the Company in February of 1999 In that case, the purported class representatives had each sought vesting of stock options after the termination of their employment, even though each had executed releases of claims in exchange for generous severance payments offered as part of the separation package In granting judgment in QUALCOMM s favor on those claims, the Court upheld the validity of those releases We are pleased that the Company has been completely vindicated in the Hanig and May cases and that virtually all of the claims in the third case have been summarily dismissed, said Louis M Lupin, senior vice president and general counsel for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM works very hard to ensure that our employees are treated not only lawfully, but fairly, and has consistently gone far beyond what the Company was legally required to do in providing for our employees and our former employees Consequently, it is very disappointing when frivolous claims such as the ones raised in these cases are made but gratifying when their lack of merit is recognized We will continue to vigorously defend against meritless claims such as these QUALCOMM Incorporated www qualcomm com is a leader in developing and delivering

As long as both indexes hold\r\nabove their May lows, it appears as though minor low might be\r\nforming. Strengthening technology stocks despite a\r\nweaker-than-expected NAPM report on Friday continues to support\r\nshort-term gains. The Dow posted a key reversal up last Friday due to\r\nlight short covering. Additional gains on Monday are needed to\r\nconfirm this bullish reversal pattern. However, momentum indicators\r\nare bearish warning traders and investors alike to use caution, as\r\nthe Dow remains vulnerable to additional weakness near-term. If the\r\ndecline off May's high continues, May's reaction low crossing at\r\n10,774.10 is the Dow's next target.\r\n\r\nEuropean markets were mostly higher in overnight trading in response\r\nto strength in U.S. equity markets, which were higher overnight. The\r\nUK FTSE- 100 was up 34.20 points at 5843.80 while the German DAX-30\r\nwas 41.05 points at 6166.22 as of 11:01 BST.\r\n\r\nThe Nikkei was higher overnight after fluctuating in less than a\r\n100-point range all day. High technology and banking stocks remain\r\nweak due to earnings concerns while selected defensive stocks such as\r\nreal estate, oil and coal issues were pushed higher. The Nikkei\r\ncontinues to consolidate below the 38% retracement level of this\r\nspring's rally that crosses at 13,363. If the decline off May's high\r\ncontinues, the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995 is a\r\npotential target later this year. Momentum indicators remain bearish\r\nsignaling that additional weakness near-term is possible. The Nikkei\r\nclosed up 50 points to 13,312.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES\r\n\r\nSeptember bonds were slightly higher overnight as it extended last\r\nweek's rally. Last Friday's rally led to a breakout above this\r\nspring's downtrend line, which confirmed that a short-term bottom has\r\nbeen posted. I would not be surprised to see a setback on Monday as\r\nSeptember might try and test broken trendline line resistance\r\ncrossing near 100-00 before moving higher during June. Momentum\r\nindicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher\r\nprices into early-June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe German bond market or Bunds started the new week lower. Germany's\r\ncontribution to the market is expected to be limited, as many traders\r\nare taking the day off for a public holiday. The June Bunds were last\r\nup 0.07 at 106.63.\r\n\r\nJapanese government bond markets were nearly steady overnight as the\r\nmarket was locked in range bound trading. The lead June 10-year JGB\r\nfutures closed at 140.53 yen, up 0.01 while the yield on the\r\nbenchmark No. 231 June 10-year cash bond stood at 1.240%, down 0.005\r\nas of 1520 JT.\r\n\r\nThe ENERGY MARKETS were higher in overnight trading in response to\r\nnews that Iraq has halted oil exports in protest U.S. and U.K.\r\nefforts to impose a \"smart\" sanctions policy. Iraq's oil minister\r\nindicated that oil exports would only resume if the UN renewed the\r\noil-for-food deal for the regular six-month interval.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil gapped up on the oil embargo news from Iraq and\r\nextended gains overnight as it consolidates above the 38% retracement\r\nlevel of this year's rally crossing at 28.26. Closes below last\r\nweek's low at 27.55 would open the door for a larger-degree decline\r\nahead of this week's OPEC meeting. Momentum indicators are bearish\r\nbut nearing their respective oversold zones warning traders to use\r\ncaution as a short-term bottom might be near.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil was higher overnight but off session highs following\r\na gap higher opening. Like crude oil, heating oil rallied on news of\r\nIraq's halt of oil exports. However, July remains below this spring's\r\nuptrend line crossing near 77.60, which strongly suggests that a top\r\nand trend change has taken place. Unless July heating oil can close\r\nabove broken trendline support, May's reaction low crossing at 74.55\r\nis July's next downside target.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas was higher overnight but near session lows as the\r\nshort covering bounce began to fade in late-session trading.\r\nNevertheless, a higher close during the day session would strongly\r\nsuggest that last Thursday's spike below May's reaction low crossing\r\nat 91.20 marked a double bottom. Momentum indicators remain bearish\r\nsignaling that sideways to lower prices near-term are still possible.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas was higher overnight as it continues to\r\nconsolidate above last October's low crossing at 3.86. Multiple\r\ncloses above last week's high crossing at 4.075 would increase the\r\nodds that a short-term bottom has been posted. Short-term momentum\r\nindicators have become oversold warning bears not to press their hand\r\nas downside risk appears limited for the time being.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES\r\n\r\nThe September Euro was higher overnight as a combination of euro-\r\nsupportive and yen-negative comments from various central bankers\r\nappears to have given the currency a modest bounce. It will take\r\ncloses above last week's high crossing at 85.70 to temper the\r\nnear-term bearish outlook in the market. If the decline continues, a\r\ntest of last October's lows crossing at 83.77 is possible later this\r\nmonth. The daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) is still bearish\r\nsignaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-June\r\nare possible.\r\n\r\nThe September British Pound opened higher due to light short covering\r\novernight hinting that last Friday's low might have completed the\r\nsetback from last Wednesday's high. Momentum indicators are neutral\r\nto bullish, which suggests that sideways to higher prices into\r\nearly-June are possible. If the rebound off May's low resumes,\r\ntrendline resistance crossing near 1.4290 is September's next target.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc opened higher overnight and is challenging\r\nlast week's gap, which led to a breakout into new contract lows. It\r\nwould take closes above last Wednesday's high of .5644 to temper the\r\nbearish outlook in the market. Until then, the door is open for a\r\ntest of weekly support crossing at .5488 later this month following\r\nlast week's breakout below last October's low crossing at .5643. The\r\nADX (a trend-following indicator) is bearish signaling that\r\nadditional weakness during June is possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight and remains poised\r\nfor a test of May's high crossing at .6541 later this week. Closes\r\nabove .6541 are needed to confirm an upside breakout of May's trading\r\nrange thereby renewing this spring's rally. Momentum indicators have\r\nturned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during the\r\nfirst half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen was lower overnight due to light profit\r\ntaking. Nevertheless, last week's breakout above trading range\r\nresistance has opened the door for additional gains this spring. If\r\nthe yen's rally continues, minor resistance crossing at .8702 is the\r\nnext target later this month. The daily ADX (a trend-following\r\nindicator) has entered a bullish trend mode signaling that additional\r\nstrength is possible.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS\r\n\r\nAugust comex gold is working on a possible inside day but was lower\r\novernight as it remains poised to extend its decline off May's high\r\nfollowing last Thursday's breakout below April's uptrend line\r\ncrossing near 267.50. If August gold resumes its decline, a test of\r\nthis spring's low crossing at 257.30 is a potential target later this\r\nyear. Stochastics and RSI are bearish signaling that additional\r\nweakness into June is likely.\r\n\r\nJuly silver was slightly lower overnight as it is working on a\r\npossible inside day. A lower close during the day session would\r\nsignal an end to last Friday's short covering bounce. Momentum\r\nindicators have turned bearish signaling that additional weakness\r\nnear-term is possible. If the decline off May's high continues, a\r\ntest of the lower boundary of this spring's trading range crossing at\r\n4.31 is July's next target later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly copper was slightly higher overnight due to light short covering\r\nas it has become slightly oversold on a short-term basis following\r\nlast week's decline. However, the door remains open for a test of\r\nMay's low crossing at 74.75 later this month. Momentum indicators are\r\nbearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into early-June\r\nappears likely. Closes below May's low could lead to a test of weekly\r\nsupport crossing at 74.10 later this spring.\r\n\r\nGRAINS\r\n\r\nJuly corn was lower overnight as traders await this morning's export\r\ninspection report and this afternoon's planting progress and crop\r\nconditions reports. Cool/wet weather across the western Corn Belt has\r\nslowed early crop development and has forced some replanting as some\r\nareas have experienced excessive moisture, which has drowned out some\r\nof the crop. For the most part traders do not seem too concerned over\r\nplanting delays in the western Corn Belt but do have their eye on a\r\npotential drought, which might be developing in China. Last Friday's\r\ngap and close above May's downtrend line crossing at 1.93 1/4\r\nstrongly suggests that a short-term low has likely been posted. If\r\nJuly extends last week's short covering rally, a test of May's high\r\ncrossing at 2.11 1/2 is the next upside target. Early calls are for\r\nJuly corn to open 2 to 2 1/4 cents lower this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat was lower in overnight trading due light profit taking\r\nfollowing last Friday's test of May's uptrend line. Losses were\r\nlimited due to disease concerns in Kansas and last week's strong\r\nexport sales report. Multiple closes above May's downtrend line,\r\nwhich crosses near 2.72, would signal that a short-term bottom has\r\nbeen posted. While supply side fundamentals remain bullish, export\r\ndemand needs to show significant improvement in order for July wheat\r\nto sustain a late-spring rally. One of the most important things that\r\ncould happen to help sluggish wheat exports would be to see the U.S.\r\nDollar fall from current levels. Early calls are for July wheat to\r\nopen 1 to 1 1/4 cents lower this morning.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPEX\r\n\r\nJuly soybeans were lower in overnight trading due to light profit\r\ntaking as the market consolidates some of last week's gains. Last\r\nweek's breakout above this spring's trading range along with closes\r\nabove recent highs crossing at 4.53 1/2 have opening the door for a\r\npossible test of March's high crossing at 4.77 3/4 later this month.\r\nCool/wet weather across the Midwest Soybean Belt has raised concerns\r\nover emergence and planting delays. Traders will be closely watching\r\ntoday's export inspection, planting progress and crop conditions\r\nreports for near-term direction in the market. Early calls are for\r\nJuly soybeans to open 1 to 1 1/4 cents lower this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal was steady overnight despite last Friday's downside\r\nreversal. Stronger than expected export demand last week along with a\r\ntight domestic cash market continues to underpin the meal market.\r\nJuly meal is at an important crossroads and will need to close above\r\n168 or below 159.60 to clear up near-term direction in the market.\r\nShort-term momentum indicators are still bearish warning bulls that\r\ncloses into new highs for this spring are needed to renew the rally\r\noff March's low. Early calls are for July soybean meal to open steady\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK\r\n\r\nAugust hogs closed sharply higher for the fourth day in a row filling\r\nApril's gap crossing at 64.90. The stage is set for additional gains\r\nand a likely test of April's high crossing at 65.95 later this month.\r\nThis week's rally underpinned by fund buying is due in part to\r\nfutures discount to the cash market and ideas that loin prices should\r\nbottom next week. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that\r\nsideways to higher prices into early-June are possible.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed out the week on a high note as the stage is set\r\nfor a test of January's high crossing at 75.00 next week. The\r\ndiscount of futures to the cash market along with higher cash bids\r\nthis week continues to underpin August's rally. Momentum indicators\r\nare bullish but have become overbought warning traders to use caution\r\nas a top may be near.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER\r\n\r\nJuly coffee closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead\r\nof the weekend. However, a sell off ahead of the close tempered much\r\nof today's early gains leaving the door open for sideways to lower\r\nprices next week. This week's breakout into new contract lows has\r\nopened the door for a test of long-term support crossing at 51.70\r\nlater this month.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed higher on Friday due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Thursday's breakout below trading range support crossing at\r\n955. Momentum indicators remain bearish despite their oversold\r\ncondition hinting that additional weakness into early-June is\r\npossible. If the decline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862\r\nis July's next target.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed higher on Friday due to light short covering as it\r\nconsolidates around the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally\r\ncrossing at 857. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that\r\nsideways to lower prices next week is still possible. If the decline\r\ncontinues, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton extended this week's short covering rally as it\r\nconsolidates above psychological support crossing at 40-cents. Light\r\nsupport came from today's export sales report that came in at 107,300\r\nbales. Additional support came from news of some 300,000 to 350,000\r\nacres of west Texas cotton being destroyed by flooding. However,\r\nupside potential remains limited due to this year's burdensome\r\ncarryout levels, which are expected to grow in the coming year.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nextreme SIGNALS - Daily Trade Alerts - Only 20 Spaces Left!\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n>>> DOUBLE YOUR MONEY TRADES <<<\r\n>>> EXCLUSIVELY REVEALED <<<\r\n>>> BY IOWA SOYBEAN FARMER <<<\r\n\r\nDear Andrew:\r\n\r\nFamily farmer, hedger and trader Ken Seehusen has agreed to\r\nsend you his private personal trading signals.\r\n\r\nFor years Ken has produced extraordinary profits for\r\nhimself and an elite group of friends and traders.

The Dow posted a key reversal up last Friday due to\r\nlight short covering. Additional gains on Monday are needed to\r\nconfirm this bullish reversal pattern. However, momentum indicators\r\nare bearish warning traders and investors alike to use caution, as\r\nthe Dow remains vulnerable to additional weakness near-term. If the\r\ndecline off May's high continues, May's reaction low crossing at\r\n10,774.10 is the Dow's next target.\r\n\r\nEuropean markets were mostly higher in overnight trading in response\r\nto strength in U.S. equity markets, which were higher overnight. The\r\nUK FTSE- 100 was up 34.20 points at 5843.80 while the German DAX-30\r\nwas 41.05 points at 6166.22 as of 11:01 BST.\r\n\r\nThe Nikkei was higher overnight after fluctuating in less than a\r\n100-point range all day. High technology and banking stocks remain\r\nweak due to earnings concerns while selected defensive stocks such as\r\nreal estate, oil and coal issues were pushed higher. The Nikkei\r\ncontinues to consolidate below the 38% retracement level of this\r\nspring's rally that crosses at 13,363. If the decline off May's high\r\ncontinues, the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995 is a\r\npotential target later this year. Momentum indicators remain bearish\r\nsignaling that additional weakness near-term is possible. The Nikkei\r\nclosed up 50 points to 13,312.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES\r\n\r\nSeptember bonds were slightly higher overnight as it extended last\r\nweek's rally. Last Friday's rally led to a breakout above this\r\nspring's downtrend line, which confirmed that a short-term bottom has\r\nbeen posted. I would not be surprised to see a setback on Monday as\r\nSeptember might try and test broken trendline line resistance\r\ncrossing near 100-00 before moving higher during June. Momentum\r\nindicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher\r\nprices into early-June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe German bond market or Bunds started the new week lower. Germany's\r\ncontribution to the market is expected to be limited, as many traders\r\nare taking the day off for a public holiday. The June Bunds were last\r\nup 0.07 at 106.63.\r\n\r\nJapanese government bond markets were nearly steady overnight as the\r\nmarket was locked in range bound trading. The lead June 10-year JGB\r\nfutures closed at 140.53 yen, up 0.01 while the yield on the\r\nbenchmark No. 231 June 10-year cash bond stood at 1.240%, down 0.005\r\nas of 1520 JT.\r\n\r\nThe ENERGY MARKETS were higher in overnight trading in response to\r\nnews that Iraq has halted oil exports in protest U.S. and U.K.\r\nefforts to impose a \"smart\" sanctions policy. Iraq's oil minister\r\nindicated that oil exports would only resume if the UN renewed the\r\noil-for-food deal for the regular six-month interval.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil gapped up on the oil embargo news from Iraq and\r\nextended gains overnight as it consolidates above the 38% retracement\r\nlevel of this year's rally crossing at 28.26. Closes below last\r\nweek's low at 27.55 would open the door for a larger-degree decline\r\nahead of this week's OPEC meeting. Momentum indicators are bearish\r\nbut nearing their respective oversold zones warning traders to use\r\ncaution as a short-term bottom might be near.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil was higher overnight but off session highs following\r\na gap higher opening. Like crude oil, heating oil rallied on news of\r\nIraq's halt of oil exports. However, July remains below this spring's\r\nuptrend line crossing near 77.60, which strongly suggests that a top\r\nand trend change has taken place. Unless July heating oil can close\r\nabove broken trendline support, May's reaction low crossing at 74.55\r\nis July's next downside target.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas was higher overnight but near session lows as the\r\nshort covering bounce began to fade in late-session trading.\r\nNevertheless, a higher close during the day session would strongly\r\nsuggest that last Thursday's spike below May's reaction low crossing\r\nat 91.20 marked a double bottom. Momentum indicators remain bearish\r\nsignaling that sideways to lower prices near-term are still possible.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas was higher overnight as it continues to\r\nconsolidate above last October's low crossing at 3.86. Multiple\r\ncloses above last week's high crossing at 4.075 would increase the\r\nodds that a short-term bottom has been posted. Short-term momentum\r\nindicators have become oversold warning bears not to press their hand\r\nas downside risk appears limited for the time being.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES\r\n\r\nThe September Euro was higher overnight as a combination of euro-\r\nsupportive and yen-negative comments from various central bankers\r\nappears to have given the currency a modest bounce. It will take\r\ncloses above last week's high crossing at 85.70 to temper the\r\nnear-term bearish outlook in the market. If the decline continues, a\r\ntest of last October's lows crossing at 83.77 is possible later this\r\nmonth. The daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) is still bearish\r\nsignaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-June\r\nare possible.\r\n\r\nThe September British Pound opened higher due to light short covering\r\novernight hinting that last Friday's low might have completed the\r\nsetback from last Wednesday's high. Momentum indicators are neutral\r\nto bullish, which suggests that sideways to higher prices into\r\nearly-June are possible. If the rebound off May's low resumes,\r\ntrendline resistance crossing near 1.4290 is September's next target.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc opened higher overnight and is challenging\r\nlast week's gap, which led to a breakout into new contract lows. It\r\nwould take closes above last Wednesday's high of .5644 to temper the\r\nbearish outlook in the market. Until then, the door is open for a\r\ntest of weekly support crossing at .5488 later this month following\r\nlast week's breakout below last October's low crossing at .5643. The\r\nADX (a trend-following indicator) is bearish signaling that\r\nadditional weakness during June is possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight and remains poised\r\nfor a test of May's high crossing at .6541 later this week. Closes\r\nabove .6541 are needed to confirm an upside breakout of May's trading\r\nrange thereby renewing this spring's rally. Momentum indicators have\r\nturned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during the\r\nfirst half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen was lower overnight due to light profit\r\ntaking. Nevertheless, last week's breakout above trading range\r\nresistance has opened the door for additional gains this spring. If\r\nthe yen's rally continues, minor resistance crossing at .8702 is the\r\nnext target later this month. The daily ADX (a trend-following\r\nindicator) has entered a bullish trend mode signaling that additional\r\nstrength is possible.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS\r\n\r\nAugust comex gold is working on a possible inside day but was lower\r\novernight as it remains poised to extend its decline off May's high\r\nfollowing last Thursday's breakout below April's uptrend line\r\ncrossing near 267.50. If August gold resumes its decline, a test of\r\nthis spring's low crossing at 257.30 is a potential target later this\r\nyear. Stochastics and RSI are bearish signaling that additional\r\nweakness into June is likely.\r\n\r\nJuly silver was slightly lower overnight as it is working on a\r\npossible inside day. A lower close during the day session would\r\nsignal an end to last Friday's short covering bounce. Momentum\r\nindicators have turned bearish signaling that additional weakness\r\nnear-term is possible. If the decline off May's high continues, a\r\ntest of the lower boundary of this spring's trading range crossing at\r\n4.31 is July's next target later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly copper was slightly higher overnight due to light short covering\r\nas it has become slightly oversold on a short-term basis following\r\nlast week's decline. However, the door remains open for a test of\r\nMay's low crossing at 74.75 later this month. Momentum indicators are\r\nbearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into early-June\r\nappears likely. Closes below May's low could lead to a test of weekly\r\nsupport crossing at 74.10 later this spring.\r\n\r\nGRAINS\r\n\r\nJuly corn was lower overnight as traders await this morning's export\r\ninspection report and this afternoon's planting progress and crop\r\nconditions reports. Cool/wet weather across the western Corn Belt has\r\nslowed early crop development and has forced some replanting as some\r\nareas have experienced excessive moisture, which has drowned out some\r\nof the crop. For the most part traders do not seem too concerned over\r\nplanting delays in the western Corn Belt but do have their eye on a\r\npotential drought, which might be developing in China. Last Friday's\r\ngap and close above May's downtrend line crossing at 1.93 1/4\r\nstrongly suggests that a short-term low has likely been posted. If\r\nJuly extends last week's short covering rally, a test of May's high\r\ncrossing at 2.11 1/2 is the next upside target. Early calls are for\r\nJuly corn to open 2 to 2 1/4 cents lower this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat was lower in overnight trading due light profit taking\r\nfollowing last Friday's test of May's uptrend line. Losses were\r\nlimited due to disease concerns in Kansas and last week's strong\r\nexport sales report. Multiple closes above May's downtrend line,\r\nwhich crosses near 2.72, would signal that a short-term bottom has\r\nbeen posted. While supply side fundamentals remain bullish, export\r\ndemand needs to show significant improvement in order for July wheat\r\nto sustain a late-spring rally. One of the most important things that\r\ncould happen to help sluggish wheat exports would be to see the U.S.\r\nDollar fall from current levels. Early calls are for July wheat to\r\nopen 1 to 1 1/4 cents lower this morning.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPEX\r\n\r\nJuly soybeans were lower in overnight trading due to light profit\r\ntaking as the market consolidates some of last week's gains. Last\r\nweek's breakout above this spring's trading range along with closes\r\nabove recent highs crossing at 4.53 1/2 have opening the door for a\r\npossible test of March's high crossing at 4.77 3/4 later this month.\r\nCool/wet weather across the Midwest Soybean Belt has raised concerns\r\nover emergence and planting delays. Traders will be closely watching\r\ntoday's export inspection, planting progress and crop conditions\r\nreports for near-term direction in the market. Early calls are for\r\nJuly soybeans to open 1 to 1 1/4 cents lower this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal was steady overnight despite last Friday's downside\r\nreversal. Stronger than expected export demand last week along with a\r\ntight domestic cash market continues to underpin the meal market.\r\nJuly meal is at an important crossroads and will need to close above\r\n168 or below 159.60 to clear up near-term direction in the market.\r\nShort-term momentum indicators are still bearish warning bulls that\r\ncloses into new highs for this spring are needed to renew the rally\r\noff March's low. Early calls are for July soybean meal to open steady\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK\r\n\r\nAugust hogs closed sharply higher for the fourth day in a row filling\r\nApril's gap crossing at 64.90. The stage is set for additional gains\r\nand a likely test of April's high crossing at 65.95 later this month.\r\nThis week's rally underpinned by fund buying is due in part to\r\nfutures discount to the cash market and ideas that loin prices should\r\nbottom next week. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that\r\nsideways to higher prices into early-June are possible.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed out the week on a high note as the stage is set\r\nfor a test of January's high crossing at 75.00 next week. The\r\ndiscount of futures to the cash market along with higher cash bids\r\nthis week continues to underpin August's rally. Momentum indicators\r\nare bullish but have become overbought warning traders to use caution\r\nas a top may be near.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER\r\n\r\nJuly coffee closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead\r\nof the weekend. However, a sell off ahead of the close tempered much\r\nof today's early gains leaving the door open for sideways to lower\r\nprices next week. This week's breakout into new contract lows has\r\nopened the door for a test of long-term support crossing at 51.70\r\nlater this month.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed higher on Friday due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Thursday's breakout below trading range support crossing at\r\n955. Momentum indicators remain bearish despite their oversold\r\ncondition hinting that additional weakness into early-June is\r\npossible. If the decline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862\r\nis July's next target.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed higher on Friday due to light short covering as it\r\nconsolidates around the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally\r\ncrossing at 857. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that\r\nsideways to lower prices next week is still possible. If the decline\r\ncontinues, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton extended this week's short covering rally as it\r\nconsolidates above psychological support crossing at 40-cents. Light\r\nsupport came from today's export sales report that came in at 107,300\r\nbales. Additional support came from news of some 300,000 to 350,000\r\nacres of west Texas cotton being destroyed by flooding. However,\r\nupside potential remains limited due to this year's burdensome\r\ncarryout levels, which are expected to grow in the coming year.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nextreme SIGNALS - Daily Trade Alerts - Only 20 Spaces Left!\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n>>> DOUBLE YOUR MONEY TRADES <<<\r\n>>> EXCLUSIVELY REVEALED <<<\r\n>>> BY IOWA SOYBEAN FARMER <<<\r\n\r\nDear Andrew:\r\n\r\nFamily farmer, hedger and trader Ken Seehusen has agreed to\r\nsend you his private personal trading signals.\r\n\r\nFor years Ken has produced extraordinary profits for\r\nhimself and an elite group of friends and traders.

AMCC Delivers 10 GBPS Digital Wrapper Backplane Serializer/Deserializer For SONET/SDH Transport and Very Short Reach OC-192 Applications   SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- The Verrazano Offers Industry-Leading Jitter Generation and Provides a 25 Percent Savings in System Bandwidth, Extending the Life of Existing   Backplane Designs  Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) today announced the Verrazano (S2509), the industry's first 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper serializer/deserializer (SERDES) supporting SONET/SDH transport and Very Short Reach (VSR) OC-192 and OC-48 transponder applications utilizing four 2.488-2.67 Gbps links.   The Verrazano facilitates the development of SONET/SDH compliant serial backplanes, saving system developers up to 25 percent of a system's total bandwidth that would otherwise be lost with 8B/10B encoding schemes. Running 27-1 PRBS data on all channels, the device features an ultra-low transmit jitter generation of 36 picoseconds peak-to-peak (typical) and provides outstanding eye diagram characteristics with a 91 percent eye opening allowing for increased reach connections at ultra low error rates. (See figure 1).   System developers benefit from the Verrazano's SONET/SDH compliance and compatibility with AMCC's industry-leading Mekong and Zambezi framing and switching devices. By interfacing with AMCC's Hudson Digital Wrapper device, the Verrazano provides the only complete solution for a mid-plane based Digital Wrapper design. (See figure 2). Very Short Reach OC-192 applications utilize the Verrazano's compatibility with AMCC's S7022 and S7025 parallel fiber components. This makes the company's VSR solution ideal for system developers needing plug-n-play VSR links up to 300 meters for rack-to-rack and chassis-to-chassis interconnections as well as board-to-board optical backplane connectivity found in large terabit systems.   \"The Verrazano is the industry's first 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper SERDES supporting the ITU G.709 standard while combining excellent jitter generation specifications with improved bandwidth efficiency,\" said Jon Siann, director of marketing at AMCC. \"By delivering complete and intelligent connectivity devices to our customers, AMCC demonstrates its commitment to providing total system solutions for the next generation of optical networks and the terabit connectivity market.\"   Manufactured in low cost CMOS technology, the device features a power consumption of 5.2 W typical and runs from 1.8 V and 2.5 V power supplies. The Verrazano supports FEC encoded and non-FEC encoded Digital Wrapper frames and provides Optical Channel Overhead insert and drop and Digital Wrapper BIP-8 monitoring for improved signal integrity. Performance monitoring features including SONET/SDH B1 and Digital Wrapper BIP-8 monitoring, Out Of Frame (OOF), Lock Detect and FIFO Over/Underflow provide link integrity monitoring in conjunction with signal integrity enhancement features, which include differential CML high-speed I/O, on-chip terminations, programmable output swing, redundant output drivers with individual squelch control and passive equalization; all of which extend the life of existing low-cost backplane designs.   TDM transport systems can upgrade existing backplanes from OC-12 rates to OC-48 rates across the backplane by utilizing the signal integrity and link monitoring. The device also supports OC-192c inverse muxing with full transparency allowing DWDM network operators to maintain proprietary in-band messaging.   Pricing and Availability  The Verrazano (S2509) is currently sampling to development partners with volume production scheduled for Q3 2001. Packaged in a 483-pin FCPBGA, the device is priced at $360 in volume quantities.

Don't wait any longer!\r\nhttp://www.internet.com/sections/careers.html\r\n\r\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------adv.-/\r\n\r\nWinners and Losers\r\n\r\nBy Paul Shread (mailto:pshread@internet.com)\r\n\r\nJune 4, 2001 - After April's stunning gains that continued right up until\r\nlate May, the Nasdaq and ISDEX somehow managed to finish the month of May\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nAfter peaking at 2328 on May 22, the Nasdaq fell 9% to end the month at\r\n2110, six points lower than where it began the month. And the ISDEX\r\ndropped 16% from its May 22 peak of 302 to close May 31 at 252, four\r\npoints lower than where it traded on May 1.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, it's not surprising that there were only three\r\nISDEX stocks (out of 50) that ended May with price changes of greater than\r\n30% from where they began the month. But the stock that topped the index\r\nin May was a surprise: financial services applications firm S1\r\n(NASDAQ:SONE) soared 58% after topping earnings estimates and predicting\r\nthat it will be in the black on an EBITDA basis by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe other two big ISDEX movers were to the downside. Portal Software\r\n(NASDAQ:PRSF) plunged 39% on an earnings warning, and former high-flyer\r\nAriba (NASDAQ:ARBA) lost 31% on concern about the viability of its\r\nbusiness model. The number five loser in May was also a B2B stock,\r\nCommerce One (NASDAQ:CMRC), which dropped 28%. The struggles of Ariba and\r\nCommerce One make i2 Technologies' (NASDAQ:ITWO) 15% gain last month worth\r\nnoting.\r\n\r\nAnother surprise in May was that the bottom of the list was populated by\r\nstocks that until recently were - or still are - thought of as leaders.\r\nPalm (NASDAQ:PALM) lost 29% in May on an earnings warning, but rebounded\r\nsmartly Friday on management assertions that business is improving. And\r\nJuniper Networks (NASDAQ:JNPR), one of the greatest performers in\r\n1999-2000, also lost 29% in May, as worries about the abysmal state of\r\ntelecom equipment spending began to spread to the stocks whose\r\nfundamentals are still holding up.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, resurgent GoTo.com (NASDAQ:GOTO) came in second in May with\r\na gain of 28%. On top of the stock's 141% gain that led all ISDEX stocks\r\nin April, the pay-per-click search service bears watching.\r\n\r\nRounding out the rest of the top five were: takeover candidate Ameritrade\r\n(NASDAQ:AMTD), up 26%; Vignette (NASDAQ:VIGN), up 22% on optimism over new\r\nproducts and positive analyst comments; and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), up 20%,\r\nthe one dot-com that has not only survived, but thrived.\r\n\r\nFinally, a quick technical look at the ISDEX. The index broke out of an\r\ninverse head and shoulders bottom on April 18 (see chart below) at 227.\r\nWith a head at 159 and a neckline at 227, the index had 68 points of\r\nupside potential, which it exceeded by 7 points at its 302 peak. To the\r\ndownside, 242 is first support, and 227 is critical support. To the\r\nupside, key resistance is 300-302. If the index turns back in the 292\r\nrange, it could be forming a head and shoulders top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Neither internet.com nor the writers of this newsletter makes\r\nspecific trading recommendations or gives individualized market advice.\r\nInformation contained in this newsletter is provided as an information\r\nservice only.  internet.com recommends that you get personal advice from\r\nan investment professional before buying or selling stocks or other\r\nsecurities.

AMCC Develops Zambezi, Offering STS Cross-Connect Solution for Line Card Operations Up to 40Gb/s\u001dDesigned to Interface Seamlessly With the Mekong and S2509, Zambezi Completes AMCC's Comprehensive, Digital Cross-Connect Solution   SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AMCC) (NASDAQ:AMCC) Monday announced Zambezi (S8710), an STS-1 cross-connect grooming fabric designed for line card use.   Targeted for add/drop MUX systems, digital cross-connects and multi-service switches, this device is optimized to enable 10Gb/s, 20Gb/s, and 40Gb/s line cards to be built with an integrated first and last, or Nth, stage grooming fabric. This solution is capable of switching from the STS-1 level up to and including STS-768c traffic, including arbitrarily concatenated traffic. Zambezi's single-stage, non-blocking, switch architecture, easily enables broadcast and multicast configurations. In addition, the device offers an industry-leading low power dissipation of 8W (typical).   Dual 768x768 (40Gb/s) logical-partitioning of the internal switch fabric and dual-casted IO interfaces allow a single element to be used as the 1st and Nth stages of a larger, multi-stage, CLOS switch. Zambezi is unique in offering dual-casted I/Os, allowing for seamless switching between the redundant core-stage switch elements. Sixteen I/O ports can be dual-casted allowing this device to directly drive and monitor redundant, core-stage switch elements. Zambezi can also be used stand-alone or as the core stage element in a multi-stage fabric as a 1536 x 1536 (80Gb/S) fully non-blocking switch.   \"Zambezi is an extension of our STS-1 switching capability previously demonstrated in our devices such as Danube and Missouri,\" said Neal Neslusan, director of marketing at AMCC. \"This is the first device which can be coupled with our next generation pointer processors for capability of supporting traffic up to OC-768c.\"   The cross-connect offers the capability to configure all of the I/Os to either 622Mb/s or 2.5Gb/s on a per I/O basis. Many of the pointer processors available today that may interface to a device such as Zambezi, do not offer 2.5Gb/s I/Os. Zambezi's dual-rate IO capabilities support a direct interface to these pointer processor chips. This capability includes support of a direct interface to AMCC's recently announced Mekong device. Customers may choose to use Zambezi in conjunction with Mekong and S2509 for complete port density utilization of the Zambezi.   Pricing and Availability  Zambezi (S8710) is offered in a 624-pin PBGA package and priced at $590.00 in volume quantities. It is scheduled for sampling in October 2001 and volume production Q1 of 2002.

Develops Zambezi, Offering STS Cross Connect Solution for Line Card Operations Up to 40Gb sDesigned to Interface Seamlessly With the Mekong and S2509, Zambezi Completes AMCC s Comprehensive, Digital Cross Connect Solution SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 BUSINESS WIRE Applied Micro Circuits Corp AMCC NASDAQ AMCC Monday announced Zambezi S8710 , an STS 1 cross connect grooming fabric designed for line card use Targeted for add drop MUX systems, digital cross connects and multi service switches, this device is optimized to enable 10Gb s, 20Gb s, and 40Gb s line cards to be built with an integrated first and last, or Nth, stage grooming fabric This solution is capable of switching from the STS 1 level up to and including STS 768c traffic, including arbitrarily concatenated traffic Zambezi s single stage, non blocking, switch architecture, easily enables broadcast and multicast configurations In addition, the device offers an industry leading low power dissipation of 8W typical Dual 768x768 40Gb s logical partitioning of the internal switch fabric and dual casted IO interfaces allow a single element to be used as the 1st and Nth stages of a larger, multi stage, CLOS switch Zambezi is unique in offering dual casted I Os, allowing for seamless switching between the redundant core stage switch elements Sixteen I O ports can be dual casted allowing this device to directly drive and monitor redundant, core stage switch elements Zambezi can also be used stand alone or as the core stage element in a multi stage fabric as a 1536 x 1536 80Gb S fully non blocking switch Zambezi is an extension of our STS 1 switching capability previously demonstrated in our devices such as Danube and Missouri, said Neal Neslusan, director of marketing at AMCC This is the first device which can be coupled with our next generation pointer processors for capability of supporting traffic up to OC 768c The cross connect offers the capability to configure all of the I Os to either 622Mb s or 2 5Gb s on a per I O basis Many of the pointer processors available today that may interface to a device such as Zambezi, do not offer 2 5Gb s I Os Zambezi s dual rate IO capabilities support a direct interface to these pointer processor chips This capability includes support of a direct interface to AMCC s recently announced Mekong device Customers may choose to use Zambezi in conjunction with Mekong and S2509 for complete port density utilization of the Zambezi Pricing and Availability Zambezi S8710 is offered in a 624 pin PBGA package and priced at 590 00 in volume quantities It is

The rumors swirled around two\r\ncompanies, Lucent Technologies (LU) and Sun Micro\r\nSystems (SUNW). The rumors surrounding Lucent was\r\nwhether or not it was going to merge with Alcatel (ALA) of\r\nFrance. At the end of the day Lucent and Alcatel announced\r\na surprise that they were not in imminent agreement; actually\r\nthat they were not in agreement at all and that talks were off.\r\nSun Micro started the day with a earnings warning from\r\nGoldman Sachs on the sector especially storage\r\nopportunities that encompassed not only Sun's push into\r\nthat area but also storage leaders such as EMC (EMC).\r\nAfter the close, Sun confirmed the worst by warning on\r\ntheir revenues and earnings for the present quarter. What\r\nreally shook traders and investors were the management's\r\naccusations that not only were things difficult in the US\r\nmarket but also weakening in Europe and Asia. Europe has\r\nrecently been the underpinning of optimism for the Sun's\r\nsector and their view that it is slowing rocks at the heart of\r\ninvestor hopes for the sector.\r\n\r\nWednesday - There appeared no where to hide safely with\r\nthe exception of some of the oil sector driven by\r\nExxonMobil's announcement of a 2:1 stock split and an\r\nextra $0.02 dividend on top of its normal $0.44 quarterly\r\ndividend this quarter. Two other bright spots were earnings\r\nrelated, International House of Pancakes (IHOP) and Toll\r\nBrothers (TOL). IHOP hit another 52 week high on\r\nconsistent results and a management stance committed to\r\nimprove them going forward. Toll Brothers is a high-end\r\nhomebuilder that caters to the well-heeled buyer especially\r\nempty nesters high-end reduced size homes and\r\ncommunities. As a rule the balance of the market was a\r\nwashout no matter what the sector but the tech and telecom\r\nsectors led the way lower off the warnings we mentioned\r\nfrom Alcatel (ALA) and Sun Micro (SUNW). The recent\r\nmarket falls have wiped out all the gains the market had\r\nmade since the last rate cut by the Fed earlier in May.\r\nUsually the warning season does not start until the second\r\nhalf of the last month of the quarter, for this quarter that\r\nwould be the second half of June, but warnings are starting\r\nalready. Capital expenditure budgets may have started to\r\nstabilize in the US but the have not been showing any signs\r\nof growth domestically especially in the tech and telecom\r\nareas. The large cap companies in those sectors were relying\r\non the strength in Europe and Asia to provide the growth\r\nfactor now that the US was stabilized. That hope appears to\r\nbe evaporating as the foreign markets are starting to decline.\r\nWe have known for some time that the economy was\r\nexpected to continue weak until the end of the year. The\r\nmarket is expected to look beyond that to the rebound in the\r\nfuture, at least that is if the rebound should be felt in the\r\nnext 6-9 months. Still when faced with the reality of current\r\nbad news, investors are unwilling to open up their wallets\r\nand buy.\r\n\r\nThursday - A rebound on the major indices held through\r\nuntil the close today, a day after a selloff had erased market\r\ngains posted since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates a\r\nlittle more than two weeks ago. The Nasdaq Composite\r\nended the day up by about 26 points, or 1.3%, to 2113,\r\nbreaking its three-day losing streak. The index of technology\r\nstocks fell 4.2% yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial\r\nAverage gained about 39 points to about 10,912, but it's still\r\nbelow the 11,000 benchmark. Ahead of tomorrow's\r\nemployment report, by all accounts the most important\r\neconomic event this week, government data released this\r\nmorning showed that initial jobless claims for the week\r\nended May 25 rose to 419,000 from a revised figure for the\r\nprevious week of 411,000. Economists had been expecting\r\n405,000 new claims for the week. By contrast, the\r\nfour-week average fell to 402,500 from a revised figure for\r\nthe previous week of 404,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday - A slightly better than expected employment report\r\nfor May and a slightly worse than expected NAPM reading\r\nwere shrugged off by the market to close higher. There were\r\nother mixed signals for the market to digest. Cisco (CSCO)\r\nannounced that capital expenditures continued to look weak\r\nimpacting the telecom equipment sector. The big three\r\nautomakers also surprised to the upside, mainly. GM (GM)\r\nactually reported an overall sales increase of 1% when they\r\nwere expected to decline. Truck sales were especially strong\r\nup 10% and GM is boosting production of some models.\r\nDaimler Chrysler (DCX) reported a decline in sales of 8%\r\nbut the expectation was for a decline of 14%. Ford (F)\r\nreported a 10% sales decline led by a 16% drop in Explorer\r\nsales. But there was a silver lining in that announcement that\r\ndaily sales of the Explorer rose throughout the month\r\nindicating that the drop off may be only temporary and that\r\nExplorer sales would not be impacted by the recent woes\r\nwith Bridgestone/Firestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Stock Market Indices & Trends\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nIndex:      DJIA        SP500      NASDAQ     RUT\r\n\r\nClose on\r\n6/1            10990.41   1260.67    2149.44     501.72\r\n\r\n1 Week     11005.37   1277.89    2251.03     508.62\r\nBefore\r\n% Change     -0.1         -1.3           -4.5          -1.4\r\n\r\n3 Months  10450.14   1241.23    2183.37     473.3\r\nBefore\r\n% Change      5.2          1.6           -1.6            6.0\r\n\r\n1 Year      10652.2    1448.81     3582.5      492.47\r\nBefore\r\n% Change      3.2        -13.0         -40.0          1.9\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\no DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) -  A widely used\r\nindex that tracks 30 blue-chip companies traded primarily\r\non the NYSE.\r\no SP500 (S&P 500) -  A popular index of 500 major\r\ncompanies:  400 industrial, 20 transportation, 40 utilities,\r\nand 40 financial.\r\no NASDAQ (NASDAQ Composite)-  An index tracking\r\nstocks traded by the National Association of Securities\r\nDealers (NASD).\r\no RUT (Russell 2000) -  An index that tracks 2000 U.S.\r\nsmall-cap firms;  a well-regarded measure of  small-cap\r\nstock performance.\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking Forward -\r\n\r\nThis coming week there is very little economic news coming\r\nout.

The past few weeks we have been\r\ndiscussing different types of fraud and ways to protect\r\nyourself and your money. This week we will look at\r\npromises of easy profits from buying precious metals and\r\nother commodities\r\n\r\nConsumers should be alert to companies that sell\r\ninvestments in precious metals and other commodities based\r\non sales pitches claiming customers can make a lot of\r\nmoney, with little risk, by purchasing metal through a\r\nfinancing agreement. Sometimes these companies offer\r\nopportunities to speculate on the price movement of\r\nprecious metals, or other commodities such as heating oil,\r\nwithout actually taking delivery of the commodity.\r\n\r\nThe United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission\r\n(CFTC) is the federal agency that regulates the trading of\r\ncommodity futures and options contracts in the United\r\nStates and takes action against firms suspected of illegally or\r\nfraudulently selling commodity futures and options. Over the\r\npast several years, the CFTC has taken enforcement action\r\nagainst wrongdoers who lured customers to purchase\r\npurported interests in precious metals without taking\r\ndelivery, through various misrepresentations including claims\r\nthat they would earn large profits with little risk.\r\n\r\nCertain companies advertise on radio, television or Internet\r\nweb sites, or make telephone \"cold calls,\" to promote the\r\npurchase of precious metals such as gold, silver and\r\nplatinum. The advertisements, infomercials and telephone\r\nsolicitations often promise quick riches - such as the ability\r\nto double or triple the customer's initial investment in just\r\ntwo or three months - all with low risk. Companies making\r\nsuch statements typically ask that customers pay only a small\r\npercentage of the total purchase price, and also claim that\r\nthey (or another company) will purchase and store the metal.\r\nThese companies also pretend to arrange financing for the\r\ncustomer's metal purchase so the customer can obtain a\r\nlarger profit by controlling a larger amount of metal with\r\ntheir relatively small down payment. Companies often\r\ndiscourage customers from taking delivery of the metal.\r\nThese companies often charge a commission for the\r\npurchase transaction, a loan origination fee, an interest\r\ncharge on the remaining balance (which accrues over time),\r\nand fees relating to storage and shipping of the metal they\r\npretend to purchase for the customer. Sometimes, not all of\r\nthese fees are disclosed up front.\r\n\r\nWhat's Wrong With Such Sales Pitches?\r\n\r\nCompanies making such pitches often:\r\n\r\n* lie about or overstate their ability to predict prices or the\r\ndirection of the metals markets;\r\n\r\n* minimize the degree of investment risk involved in metals\r\ninvestments;\r\n\r\n* fraudulently fail to disclose how much the price of metal\r\nmust go up for the customer to break even (let alone profit),\r\nsince hefty finance and storage fees and commissions are\r\ndeducted from the customer's account before any profits\r\naccrue;\r\n\r\n* falsely claim to be purchasing and storing the metal, when\r\nthey do not actually do so. Indeed, companies often\r\ndiscourage customers from taking delivery of the metal;\r\n\r\n* charge phony \"storage\" fees for metal, when no metal is\r\nactually purchased or stored;\r\n\r\n* charge phony \"interest\" fees that diminish a customer's\r\naccount equity to the point where the customer has to\r\ndeposit additional funds with the company or have his\r\naccount closed out at a total loss. The interest fees are phony\r\nbecause no metal has been purchased, as promised, and the\r\nfinancing arrangement therefore is fictitious;\r\n\r\n* fail to point out that, because you are buying on \"margin\"\r\nor with leverage, you will have to send the company\r\nadditional funds (or sell a portion of your \"metal position\") if\r\nthe price of the precious metals moves unfavorably.\r\n\r\nWarning Signs Of Commodity \"Come-Ons\"\r\n\r\nIf you are solicited by a company to purchase commodities,\r\nwatch for the warning signs listed below:\r\n\r\n* Avoid any company that predicts or guarantees large\r\nprofits with little or no financial risk.\r\n\r\n* Be wary of high-pressure tactics to convince you to send\r\nor transfer cash immediately to the firm, via overnight\r\ndelivery companies, the internet, by mail, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n* Be skeptical about unsolicited phone calls about\r\ninvestments from offshore salespersons or companies with\r\nwhich you are unfamiliar.\r\n\r\n* Prior to purchasing, contact the CFTC (www.cftc.gov) or\r\nother authorities, including your state's securities\r\ncommissioner (www.nasaa.org), Attorney General's\r\nconsumer protection bureau (www.naag.org/index2.html),\r\nthe Better Business Bureau (www.bbb.com) and the\r\nNational Futures Association (www.nfa.futures.org).\r\n\r\n* Be sure you get all information about the company and\r\nverify that data, if possible. If you can, check the company's\r\nmaterials with someone whose financial advice you trust.\r\n\r\n* Learn all possible information about fees and commissions\r\ncharged, and the basis for each of these charges.\r\n\r\n* If in doubt, don't invest. If you can't get solid information\r\nabout the company, the salesperson, and the investment, you\r\nmay not want to risk your money\r\n\r\nUse Extra Care When Dealing with Foreign Companies\r\n\r\nSometimes companies that solicit customer investments in\r\nprecious metals (or their purported storage facilities) are\r\nlocated outside the United States, even if they do not reveal\r\nthat fact to you while soliciting your investment. United\r\nStates government agencies generally have little or no\r\nregulatory authority over entities operating outside the\r\nUnited States. If you transfer funds to foreign firms, or place\r\nfunds with United States firms that are later transferred to\r\noffshore companies, it may be difficult or impossible for you\r\nto recover your money. Storing metal offshore, particularly\r\nin countries with secrecy laws, might make it difficult for\r\nyou to verify your investment.\r\n\r\nAsk where all companies that would handle your funds are\r\nlocated, where any telephone call you receive originates,\r\nwhere your funds will be deposited and kept, and where the\r\nmetal will be stored. If possible, telephone the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER\r\n\r\nThe information contained in the documents in this website\r\nshould not be construed as an offer to sell, or a solicitation\r\nto buy, any securities referred to herein.

investor FRAUD part 4 Commodity futures and options are prime targets forfraudulent offerings The past few weeks we have beendiscussing different types of fraud and ways to protectyourself and your money This week we will look atpromises of easy profits from buying precious metals andother commoditiesConsumers should be alert to companies that sellinvestments in precious metals and other commodities basedon sales pitches claiming customers can make a lot ofmoney, with little risk, by purchasing metal through afinancing agreement Sometimes these companies offeropportunities to speculate on the price movement ofprecious metals, or other commodities such as heating oil,without actually taking delivery of the commodity The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC is the federal agency that regulates the trading ofcommodity futures and options contracts in the UnitedStates and takes action against firms suspected of illegally orfraudulently selling commodity futures and options Over thepast several years, the CFTC has taken enforcement actionagainst wrongdoers who lured customers to purchasepurported interests in precious metals without takingdelivery, through various misrepresentations including claimsthat they would earn large profits with little risk Certain companies advertise on radio, television or Internetweb sites, or make telephone cold calls, to promote thepurchase of precious metals such as gold, silver andplatinum The advertisements, infomercials and telephonesolicitations often promise quick riches such as the abilityto double or triple the customer s initial investment in justtwo or three months all with low risk Companies makingsuch statements typically ask that customers pay only a smallpercentage of the total purchase price, and also claim thatthey or another company will purchase and store the metal These companies also pretend to arrange financing for thecustomer s metal purchase so the customer can obtain alarger profit by controlling a larger amount of metal withtheir relatively small down payment Companies oftendiscourage customers from taking delivery of the metal These companies often charge a commission for thepurchase transaction, a loan origination fee, an interestcharge on the remaining balance which accrues over time ,and fees relating to storage and shipping of the metal theypretend to purchase for the customer Sometimes, not all ofthese fees are disclosed up front What s Wrong With Such Sales Pitches Companies making such pitches often lie about or overstate their ability to predict prices or thedirection of the metals markets minimize the degree of investment risk involved in metalsinvestments fraudulently fail to disclose how much the price of metalmust go up for the customer to break even let alone profit ,since hefty finance and storage fees and commissions arededucted from the customer s account before any profitsaccrue falsely claim to be purchasing and storing the metal, whenthey do not actually do so Indeed, companies oftendiscourage customers from taking delivery of the metal charge phony storage fees for metal, when no metal isactually purchased or stored charge phony interest fees that diminish a customer saccount equity to the point where the customer has todeposit additional funds with the company or have hisaccount closed out at a total loss The interest fees are phonybecause no metal has been purchased, as promised, and thefinancing arrangement therefore is fictitious fail to point out that, because you are buying on margin or with leverage, you will have to send the companyadditional funds or sell a portion of your metal position ifthe price of the precious metals moves unfavorably Warning Signs Of Commodity Come Ons If you are solicited by a company to purchase commodities,watch for the warning signs listed below Avoid any company that predicts or guarantees largeprofits with little or no financial risk Be wary of high pressure tactics to convince you to sendor transfer cash immediately to the firm, via overnightdelivery companies, the internet, by mail, or otherwise Be skeptical about unsolicited phone calls aboutinvestments from offshore salespersons or companies withwhich you are unfamiliar Prior to purchasing, contact the CFTC www cftc gov orother authorities, including your state s securitiescommissioner www nasaa org , Attorney General sconsumer protection bureau www naag org index2 html ,the Better Business Bureau www bbb com and theNational Futures Association www nfa futures org Be sure you get all information about the company andverify that data, if possible If you can, check the company smaterials with someone whose financial advice you trust Learn all possible information about fees and commissionscharged, and the basis for each of these charges If in doubt, don t invest If you can t get solid informationabout the company, the salesperson, and the

facilities arelocated outside the United States, even if they do not revealthat fact to you while soliciting your investment UnitedStates government agencies generally have little or noregulatory authority over entities operating outside theUnited States If you transfer funds to foreign firms, or placefunds with United States firms that are later transferred tooffshore companies, it may be difficult or impossible for youto recover your money Storing metal offshore, particularlyin countries with secrecy laws, might make it difficult foryou to verify your investment Ask where all

AMCC'S Mekong IC Enables End-to-End OC-192 System Solutions for Next-Generation Intelligent Optical Network Equipment\u001dMekong Represents AMCC's Latest Generation of Oc-192 Framer Technology With Integrated Features Targeted Specifically for the Optical Networking and DWDM Equipment Markets   SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) today announced the availability of the Mekong (S19204), the industry's first highly integrated OC-192 SONET/SDH framing and pointer processor device with on-chip features critical for next generation optical networking equipment.   Mekong is a multi-feature integrated circuit enabling customers to collapse multiple functions down to one chip, including aggregation, pointer processing and grooming functions. Mekong is complemented by AMCC's best-in-class CMOS Serializers/Deserializers (SERDES), Forward Error Correction (FEC) devices and switch fabric devices, to provide an end-to-end chip set solution (See figure 1) that meets the power, cost and space requirements of new intelligent optical networking equipment.   \"Mekong's ability to re-map section and line overhead or transparently pass-thru all TOH (Transport Overhead) bytes (Standard and Reserved bytes), with pointer processing enabled, on incoming SONET/SDH signals enables intelligent optical networking equipment to provide performance monitoring and support switching/routing decisions on incoming fibers. This can all be done while providing full transparent processing of client interfaces over private DWDM networks and public networks,\" said Mark Donovan, AMCC's Mekong senior product marketing manager. \"By designing the device to interface seamlessly with AMCC's popular OC-48 transceiver and OC-192 SERDES and 10G digital wrapper/FEC solutions, we're further contributing to the company's overall system solution approach and reducing our customer's time-to-market.\"   Mekong also supports a variety of line interfaces for reducing system and board design requirements. For OC-48 interfaces Mekong supports 4-bit wide 622 Mbits/s interfaces, to enable seamless connections to AMCC's S3455 SERDES device. For OC-192 applications, Mekong provides 16-bit 622 Mbits/s interfaces for seamless connections to AMCC's 16-bit S3097/98 SERDES devices. Mekong's OC-192 interfaces are also designed for direct connection to AMCC's 10G digital wrapper/FEC Hudson device.   Mekong is AMCC's next generation framer/pointer processor device that enables the aggregation of four OC-48s into a larger OC-192 signal, or if used in conjunction with AMCC's Danube framer/pointer processor device, the aggregation of up to sixty-four OC-3s, sixteen OC-12s or logical combinations of OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48 asynchronous interfaces into a larger OC-192 signal (See figures 2 and 3). Mekong provides standard SONET/SDH pointer processing, and in addition, can transparently re-map the incoming OC-48 and OC-192 signals TOH across time domains and into the outgoing higher rate signal. Mekong also supports a pass-thru mode, where all TOH bytes (Standard and Reserved bytes) can be passed through Mekong, with pointer processing enabled, to enable full transparency across time domains. As a result, when AMCC's Danube is used in conjunction with Mekong, optical networking equipment vendors can offer service providers full transparency from OC-3 to OC-192 rates. Mekong can also perform the same functions in an OC-192-to-OC-192 mode.   Enabled by the device's two APS ports, Mekong provides protection switching and redundancy in both the multiplex and demultiplex directions and incorporates non-intrusive TOH monitoring for all inputs. The single-chip device features two built-in hitless Time Slot Interchange switches (TSIs), to provide STS-1 level traffic grooming, cross-connection, and add/drop applications. When used in conjunctions with AMCC's recently announced Zambezi, an 80G STS-1 level switch fabric device, the Mekong/Zambezi solution can serve as the first and Nth stage switch elements in a N-stage Clos switch fabric architecture (See figure 4). Mekong also offers a provisional pointer processor bypass mode for STS-192-to-STS-192 operation (through-timing); both a full framer bypass (no frame regeneration) as well as a pointer processor bypass (frame regeneration enabled) are also provided. Mekong also supports large deksew buffers in the multiplex direction for STS-192c inverse multiplexing applications. A high-speed microprocessor interface is provided for configuration and monitoring. Mekong also supports POH (B3/J1/G1/C2) monitoring, Full TOH drop and insert ports and robust alarm monitoring functions to provide the highest in OC-192 SONET/SDH integration and functionality for optical and DWDM equipment.   \"Mekong's feature-rich architecture and flexibility allows for multiple use in DWDM, Metro DWDM, digital cross-connects, multi-service access switches and core switch platforms,\" said Neal Neslusan, AMCC's marketing director of transport products. \"It is well suited for Optical-Electrical-Optical (OEO) switching applications where grooming wavelengths from the optical network and supporting electrical SONET/SDH signal switching is required.\"   Pricing and Availability  The Mekong (S19204) is scheduled for sampling to development partners in August, with volume production scheduled for Q4 2001. Packaged in a 624 CBGA, the device is priced at $775.00 in volume quantities.

Broadcom Announces World's Broadest Offering of Bluetooth Qualified Components   MONTE CARLO, Monaco, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Bluetooth Congress 2001   Bluetooth Version 1.1 Qualifications of BCM2001, BCM2002X, BCM2019,    BCM2039 and LMP Make Blutonium(TM) the Broadest Line of Qualified                     Bluetooth Components Available  Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq:BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband communications, today announced the broadest line of Bluetooth(TM) version 1.1-qualified components in the industry. Broadcom's qualified components include a full suite of radio and baseband chips, as well as Link Manager Protocol (LMP) firmware, providing end-to-end enabling technology for a range of Bluetooth applications. This means that devices developed using Broadcom's Blutonium(TM) chips and firmware can attain Bluetooth qualification with minimal effort, accelerating the time-to-market for these products.   \"Our Blutonium line provides our customers with unmatched flexibility in the development of their pre-qualified Bluetooth products,\" said Scott Bibaud, Director of Bluetooth Marketing for Broadcom. \"With multiple Bluetooth-qualified basebands and radios, as well as a qualified LMP, Broadcom can provide equipment developers with the solution that's right for their application.\"   The Blutonium line consists of two standalone all-CMOS Bluetooth radios, the Broadcom(R) BCM2001 for general applications and the BCM2002X, a radio-only chip optimized for use in mobile phones. In addition, the family includes two baseband processor chips, the BCM2039 standalone baseband and the BCM2019 host-based baseband chip that includes no on-board processor and instead leverages the processor of its host device. Broadcom's LMP firmware stack provides the processor logic that manages connections between Bluetooth devices.   \"One of the benefits of Bluetooth is the ability to allow many different types of data devices to share information over the air,\" Bibaud said. \"As a result, no `one-size-fits-all' solution can truly accommodate the breadth of applications created by this technology. We've developed the Blutonium line to include a variety of Bluetooth-qualified silicon and system solutions to enable whatever applications our customers dream up, providing functionality optimized for their product needs and getting those products through the qualification process and to the market in short order.\"   With high receiver sensitivity and excellent blocking performance, the Blutonium product line is ideally suited to perform well in harsh radio frequency (RF) environments such as inside mobile phones and laptop computers or in geographical areas with high concentrations of radio interference. Blutonium supports the complete Bluetooth 1.1 feature set, including full data rate, seven slave piconet with master/slave switching, and scatternet. Manufactured in a standard digital CMOS process, the Blutonium line features high levels of integration, incorporating all RF circuits on-chip and requiring very few external passive components, which reduces system cost and board space requirements.   Qualifications of the BCM2001 and BCM2002 were performed by Hyper Corporation, a Bluetooth Qualification Body (BQB) in Pleasanton, California, while qualifications of the BCM2019 and BCM2039 were performed by 7 Layers, a BQB located in Irvine, California. The qualification process consisted of testing of the baseband chips and LMP firmware, as well as some radio testing by the BQBs, and verification of test data against specifications set by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). In accordance with these procedures, Hyper and 7 Layers performed testing and reviewed Broadcom's test results, verifying compliance of the transceivers and ensuring that products using the chips will be eligible to bear the Bluetooth logo. The Broadcom transceivers were qualified with no waivers.   About Broadcom  Broadcom Corporation is the leading provider of highly integrated silicon solutions that enable broadband communications and networking of voice, video and data services. Using proprietary technologies and advanced design methodologies, Broadcom designs, develops and supplies complete system-on-a-chip solutions and related applications for digital cable set-top boxes and cable modems, high-speed local, metropolitan and wide area and optical networks, home networking, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), carrier access, residential broadband gateways, direct broadcast satellite and terrestrial digital broadcast, digital subscriber lines (xDSL), wireless communications, System I/O(TM) server solutions and network processing.

suite of radio and baseband chips, as well as Link Manager Protocol LMP firmware, providing end to end enabling technology for a range of Bluetooth applications This means that devices developed using Broadcom s Blutonium TM chips and firmware can attain Bluetooth qualification with minimal effort, accelerating the time to market for these products Our Blutonium line provides our customers with unmatched flexibility in the development of their pre qualified Bluetooth products, said Scott Bibaud, Director of Bluetooth Marketing for Broadcom With multiple Bluetooth qualified basebands and radios, as well as a qualified LMP, Broadcom can provide equipment developers with the solution that s right for their application The Blutonium line consists of two standalone all CMOS Bluetooth radios, the Broadcom R BCM2001 for general applications and the BCM2002X, a radio only chip optimized for use in mobile phones In addition, the family includes two baseband processor chips, the BCM2039 standalone baseband and the BCM2019 host based baseband chip that includes no on board processor and instead leverages the processor of its host device Broadcom s LMP firmware stack provides the processor logic that manages connections between Bluetooth devices One of the benefits of Bluetooth is the ability to allow many different types of data devices to share information over the air, Bibaud said As a result, no one size fits all solution can truly accommodate the breadth of applications created by this technology We ve developed the Blutonium line to include a variety of Bluetooth qualified silicon and system solutions to enable whatever applications our customers dream up, providing functionality optimized for their product needs and getting those products through the qualification process and to the market in short order With high receiver sensitivity and excellent blocking performance, the Blutonium product line is ideally suited to perform well in harsh radio frequency RF environments such as inside mobile phones and laptop computers or in geographical areas with high concentrations of radio interference Blutonium supports the complete Bluetooth 1 1 feature set, including full data rate, seven slave piconet with master slave switching, and scatternet Manufactured in a standard digital CMOS process, the Blutonium line features high levels of integration, incorporating all RF circuits on chip and requiring very few external passive components, which reduces system cost and board space requirements Qualifications of the BCM2001 and BCM2002 were performed by Hyper Corporation, a Bluetooth Qualification Body BQB in Pleasanton, California, while qualifications of the BCM2019 and BCM2039 were performed by 7 Layers, a BQB located in Irvine, California The qualification process consisted of testing of the baseband chips and LMP firmware, as well as some radio testing by the BQBs, and verification of test data against specifications set by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group SIG In accordance with these procedures, Hyper and 7 Layers performed testing and reviewed Broadcom s test results, verifying compliance of the transceivers and ensuring that products using the chips will be eligible to bear the Bluetooth logo The Broadcom transceivers were qualified with no waivers About Broadcom Broadcom Corporation is the leading provider

Broadcom Introduces High-Performance Single-Chip All-CMOS Bluetooth Radio   MONTE CARLO, Monaco, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Bluetooth Congress 2001   Blutonium(TM) Chip Combines Radio and Baseband Functions on           Monolithic High-Performance Single-Chip Transceiver  Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq:BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband communications, today introduced the Broadcom(R) BCM2033 single-chip transceiver for Bluetooth(TM) wireless applications. Integrating previously developed, Bluetooth-compliant radio and baseband components onto a single high-performance integrated circuit, the chip minimizes component counts and board space requirements while providing a high-performance solution to the Bluetooth short-range wireless connectivity challenges faced by equipment manufacturers.   The Blutonium(TM) BCM2033 achieves the highest performance of any single-chip Bluetooth transceiver in the industry, combining Bluetooth-qualified radio and baseband circuits onto a single monolithic chip. On-board Fractional-N synthesizer technology allows the chip to work with practically any reference frequency available. This is especially useful in current and third generation (3G) cellular phones in which a wide variety of crystal oscillators are available. Featuring high levels of integration and minimal off-chip filters or other active components, the BCM2033 provides excellent performance in the presence of radio interferers and is ideally suited for harsh radio frequency (RF) environments, such as inside mobile phones and laptop computers. In addition, the chip's unique design allows it to maintain its high performance even across the extended temperature range of between -40 and +105 degrees centigrade, an accomplishment unparalleled in the industry.   \"With our previously announced Blutonium products, we demonstrated our unique ability to achieve outstanding radio performance designing chips in a standard digital CMOS process,\" said K.C. Murphy, Vice President and General Manager of Broadcom's RF and Advanced Mixed Signal Business Unit. \"We've now applied Broadcom's well-known integration expertise by combining RF and digital circuits onto a single substrate while maintaining unmatched performance among Bluetooth transceivers. As a result, we're unveiling the single-chip Bluetooth transceiver the industry has been waiting for, with performance exceeding that of practically any other solution, regardless of the process technology.\"   The BCM2033 is based upon Broadcom's previous all-CMOS stand-alone radios and basebands that have already achieved Bluetooth Version 1.1 qualification and which exceed the Bluetooth specification in most areas. This means that devices such as mobile phones and PC cards built using Blutonium components are compatible with the latest version of the Bluetooth specification, easing the process by which these devices can apply the Bluetooth logo to their products. The BCM2033 benefits from this previous development, achieving strong performance in key areas such as linearity and receiver sensitivity, attaining a sensitivity figure of better than -82 dBm.   Integration of the previously developed circuits onto a single chip was made possible because the entire Blutonium line, like all Broadcom chip products, was developed in a standard digital CMOS (or Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) manufacturing process. No other process allows the combination of RF and digital circuits on a single transceiver.   \"By first proving our radio and baseband architectures in CMOS with standalone products, we've chosen to emphasize performance in our Bluetooth component development program,\" said Scott Bibaud, Director of Marketing for Broadcom's Bluetooth Products. \"With these multiple Blutonium elements integrated onto a single cost-effective chip, we can now leverage Broadcom's proven reputation for operational excellence and provide these components in production quantities to our customers around the world.\"   Key Features  The BCM2033 has been designed to provide very high performance in Bluetooth applications with a single transceiver. Notable features include:   --  Strong spurious emissions performance -- the BCM2033 minimizes     interference from transmissions taking place in the bands used by     mobile phones, providing robust connections between Bluetooth     devices.  --  Exceptional blocking performance -- the highly linear design     eliminates the need for costly off-chip RF filtering to receive     reliable signals from other Bluetooth devices.  --  Fractional-N Synthesizer -- this synthesizer enables the 2033 to     use any existing frequency reference, including those commonly     available in mobile phones such as CDMA, WCDMA, GSM, GPRS, and     UMTS, eliminating the need for an off-chip crystal.  --  Extensive software support -- the BCM2033 is software-compatible     with protocol stacks developed by leading third party stack     vendors, as well as with Broadcom's internal stack.  --  Cost-effective memory architecture -- on-chip memory eliminates     the need for off-chip flash while allowing the use of additional     memory when appropriate.  --  Requires minimal off-chip components -- by eliminating all     external active components, the BCM2033 requires just a few     passive components, providing very limited bill of materials (BOM)     and board space impact on OEM equipment designs.     Availability  The version of the BCM2033 with no external memory bus is packaged in a 64-pin fine pitch Ball Grid Array (fpBGA) and the version with external flash interfaces is packaged in a 100-pin fpBGA. The transceiver is sampling now to early access customers.

Broadcom Introduces High Performance Single Chip All CMOS Bluetooth Radio MONTE CARLO, Monaco, Jun 4, 2001 BUSINESS WIRE Bluetooth Congress 2001 Blutonium TM Chip Combines Radio and Baseband Functions on Monolithic High Performance Single Chip Transceiver Broadcom Corporation Nasdaq BRCM , the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband communications, today introduced the Broadcom R BCM2033 single chip transceiver for Bluetooth TM wireless applications Integrating previously developed, Bluetooth compliant radio and baseband components onto a single high performance integrated circuit, the chip minimizes component counts and board space requirements while providing a high performance solution to the Bluetooth short range wireless connectivity challenges faced by equipment manufacturers The Blutonium TM BCM2033 achieves the highest performance of any single chip Bluetooth transceiver in the industry, combining Bluetooth qualified radio and baseband circuits onto a single monolithic chip On board Fractional N synthesizer technology allows the chip to work with practically any reference frequency available This is especially useful in current and third generation 3G cellular phones in which a wide variety of crystal oscillators are available Featuring high levels of integration and minimal off chip filters or other active components, the BCM2033 provides excellent performance in the presence of radio interferers and is ideally suited for harsh radio frequency RF environments, such as inside mobile phones and laptop computers In addition, the chip s unique design allows it to maintain its high performance even across the extended temperature range of between 40 and 105 degrees centigrade, an accomplishment unparalleled in the industry With our previously announced Blutonium products, we demonstrated our unique ability to achieve outstanding radio performance designing chips in a standard digital CMOS process, said K C Murphy, Vice President and General Manager of Broadcom s RF and Advanced Mixed Signal Business Unit We ve now applied Broadcom s well known integration expertise by combining RF and digital circuits onto a single substrate while maintaining unmatched performance among Bluetooth transceivers As a result, we re unveiling the single chip Bluetooth transceiver the industry has been waiting for, with performance exceeding that of practically any other solution, regardless of the process technology The BCM2033 is based upon Broadcom s previous all CMOS stand alone radios and basebands that have already achieved Bluetooth Version 1 1 qualification and which exceed the Bluetooth specification in most areas This means that devices such as mobile phones and PC cards built using Blutonium components are compatible with the latest version of the Bluetooth specification, easing the process by which these devices can apply the Bluetooth logo to their products The BCM2033 benefits from this previous development, achieving strong performance in key areas such as linearity and receiver sensitivity, attaining a sensitivity figure of better than 82 dBm Integration of the previously developed circuits onto a single chip was made possible because the entire Blutonium line, like all Broadcom chip products, was developed in a standard digital CMOS or Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor manufacturing process No other process allows the combination of RF and digital circuits on a single transceiver By first proving our radio and baseband architectures in CMOS with standalone products, we ve chosen to emphasize performance in our Bluetooth component development program, said Scott Bibaud, Director of Marketing for Broadcom s Bluetooth Products With these multiple Blutonium elements integrated onto a single cost effective chip, we can now leverage Broadcom s proven reputation for operational excellence and provide these components in production quantities to our customers around the world Key Features The BCM2033 has been designed to provide very high performance in Bluetooth applications with a single transceiver Notable features include Strong spurious emissions performance the BCM2033 minimizes interference from transmissions taking place in the bands used by mobile phones, providing robust connections between Bluetooth devices Exceptional blocking performance the highly linear design eliminates the need for costly off chip RF filtering to receive reliable signals from other Bluetooth devices Fractional N Synthesizer this synthesizer enables the 2033 to use any existing frequency reference, including those commonly available in mobile phones such as CDMA, WCDMA, GSM, GPRS, and UMTS, eliminating the need for an off chip crystal Extensive software support the BCM2033 is software compatible with protocol stacks developed by leading third party stack vendors, as well as with Broadcom s internal stack Cost effective memory architecture on chip memory eliminates the need for off chip flash while allowing the use of additional memory when appropriate Requires minimal off chip components by eliminating all external active components, the BCM2033 requires just a few passive components, providing very limited bill of materials BOM and board space impact on OEM equipment designs Availability The version of the BCM2033 with no external memory bus is packaged in a 64 pin fine pitch Ball Grid Array fpBGA and the version with external flash interfaces is packaged in a 100 pin fpBGA The transceiver is sampling now to early access customers About

Even the world's most powerful nation is currently experiencing an energy shortage, which has forced many to seek alternative sources of energy. The solution is quite simple, either purchase oil & gas from other nations or produce additional supplies from within, which the Asdar Group is firmly positioned to do.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Asdar Group has a 50% working interest (Harvester Property scheduled to commence in early summer 2001) in a re-entry drill program located in the San Joaquin Basin in Bakersfield, California. Projected recoveries are 25-30% of approximately 6,000,000 barrels of oil and 60% of 90 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas. In addition, the Asdar Group has a 25% working interest in LAK Ranch, an enhanced oil recovery program using SAGD (steam assisted gravity drainage) technology in the Powder River Basin near Newcastle, Wyoming. To date, over $US6,800,000 has been spent on a SAGD commercial pilot plant currently in operation. With 100,000,000 plus barrels of oil in place and a 70% recovery potential (based on third party engineering reports) all oil produced has been and will be sold at full West Texas Intermediate prices.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the Asdar Group is firmly committed to producing high quality energy sources, which are so desperately needed in today's ever-changing environmental landscape.\r\n\r\nAn investment in XBET is particularly suited for investors with above-average risk tolerance, who are seeking a potential for capital appreciation and who have diversified investment portfolios.\r\n\r\nFor further information and a complete investor package, please contact Investor Relations at 1-800-773-7317 or reply by email and type \"add XBET\" in the subject header.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This transmission was intended only for the party or parties to whom it was directed.

I would like to personally\r\nthank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this letter\r\nand to consider Merchant Capital, Inc. as your Commodities Brokerage firm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Wilson\r\nSr. Broker\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember, at Merchant Capital, Inc., we work for you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Trader,\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered what's the difference between a successful\r\ncommodities trader and a non-successful trader? The answer is not that\r\ndifficult, it's knowledge! Knowledge can be obtained several different ways.\r\nOne way, is the \"school of hard knocks\" which many people have honorary\r\ndegrees but no money.(I've been there, in case you are wondering) Another\r\nway, a better way, is to find someone who knows how to trade and have that\r\nperson teach you. This is certainly a better, and less costly, choice.\r\n\r\nMy name is David Duty and I started trading over five years ago after I got\r\na brochure in the mail about trading commodities. It seemed interesting and\r\nI got pretty excited about the possibilities. I ordered a course that\r\npromised everything, but delivered almost nothing. I lost $10,000 in less\r\nthan 90 days, not to mention the $5,000 I threw away on these courses. I\r\nquickly found out that I did not know what I was doing.\r\n\r\nThen, I got mad, not at the man who sold me the almost worthless courses,\r\nbut at myself for jumping into something without knowing what I was doing. I\r\nask myself, \"What's The Difference\" between someone who trades, and\r\nconsistently makes money, and what I was doing. I found the answer pretty\r\nsimple. Like I said, it's knowledge. So, I took a year off and studied and\r\nread everything I could lay my hands on. During this time, I found a lot of\r\ngood material and some that was so bad that the person who wrote them should\r\nhave been shot!\r\n\r\nI started compiling information that I deemed to be reliable, that had\r\nsubstance to it. What I found was a common thread among them. I started\r\nformulating a trading plan and put that plan into action. This time, it was\r\ncompletely different. I was trading and making money, and was only spending\r\nabout an hour a day at it, and some days, as little as 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nI then had friends and relatives who saw what I was doing and they too\r\nwanted to learn how to trade. So, I started teaching some of them how to\r\ntrade. Then, people they knew wanted to learn also, so I started teaching a\r\nclass at a local college and the rest is history.\r\n\r\nI've written an in-depth 450 page course, designed to teach you how to\r\nsuccessfully trade commodities. I have students on every continent (yes,\r\nthat includes Antarctica) and in over 20 countries. I'm also doing seminars\r\naround the world and having the time of my life doing it. My course has been\r\nrated the #1 course on the market by my students, who collectively, have\r\nbought probably every other course ever written.\r\n\r\nI also have a \"Mini-Course\" which is almost 100 pages and I would like to\r\nsend it to you FREE. That's right, for free. No strings attached. This\r\nMini-Course\", is the first three lessons in my full course, which like I\r\nsaid, is 450 pages. This will give you a very good idea of what my full\r\ncourse offers. Read it at your leisure and if you like it, and I think you\r\nwill, you can order the full course at my web-site. I've had many people\r\nwrite me and tell me that they learned more from this Mini-Course than from\r\ncourses they paid several hundreds of dollars for.\r\n\r\nI will also put you on my guest list for 30 days also. You will get ongoing\r\nlessons, live chats, access to my student only forum, full access to my\r\nweb-site, market alerts, and market analysis. Again this is free! In\r\naddition, if you would like to attend a seminar that I do, I'll give you a\r\n25% discount to that as well.\r\n\r\nTo get a free copy of my Mini-Course, just click on this link,\r\nhttp://www.davidduty.com/merchant/req_mini_course.htm\r\nand you can instantly download it.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the Mini-Course and I look forward to having you as a\r\nstudent or meeting you in person at one of my seminars. If you have any\r\nquestions, my e-mail address and phone number are below.  If you e-mail me,\r\nI'll get back to you usually within a few hours.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nDavid G.

In just one week, this group has surged from\r\na 0 percentile rank to a near-sizzling 79th percentile rank.\r\nThis is especially remarkable, as prior to its most recent\r\nshowing, a 19th percentile ranking was the highest it had\r\nmustered, dating back to April 30th.  Other groups within\r\nthe Leisure/films sector have also done well as a result,\r\nwith the Leisure/film/entertainment {.FIL} group rising to\r\nan 80th percentile rank, from a 63rd percentile rank just\r\nthree weeks ago.  Of course this sector continues to derive\r\nits success from the Leisure/film/theaters {.FTH} group,\r\nwhich has never charted a percentile rank lower than 98th\r\nin past 11 weeks!\r\n\r\nIndustry Group Analysis is just another of the many great\r\nreasons to be a subscriber to the Wall Street City website.\r\nBesides great industry group analysis and incredible\r\nstock analysis, you also get access to the world's most\r\npowerful stock screening tool on the planet, ProSearch,\r\nall in one subcription package.

Accordingly,\r\nthe Retail/stores/apparel {.RAP} group has also warmed up,\r\nmoving from a 42nd to 86th percentile rank over the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\nTextiles/producer {.TPR}, Publishing/graphic {.GRA}, and\r\nHome/jewelry/silverware {.JSW}, are also groups which have\r\nexperienced a heating up.  TPR has surged from a 42nd to a\r\n71st percentile rank in only a month, while GRA has soared\r\nto a 81st ranking from the 7th percentile, within the same\r\ntime frame.

Light support came from biotech\r\nstocks however trading was rather light. Session highs in the\r\nSeptember S&P 500 index fell short of filling last Wednesday's gap at\r\n1278.50 as the rebound off last week's low still appears corrective\r\nin nature. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq did fill last week's gap but closed\r\nbelow the opening range leaving the door open for a possible setback\r\non Tuesday. Momentum indicators remain bearish hinting that\r\nadditional weakness near-term is possible. If the declines resume,\r\nMay's reaction lows are potential targets.\r\n\r\nThe Dow managed to close higher on Monday led by gains in oil stock\r\nthereby confirming last Friday's key reversal up. If the Dow can post\r\na higher weekly close it could set the stage for a resumption of this\r\nspring's rally later this month.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES September bonds extended last week's breakout above\r\nthis spring's downtrend line crossing near 100-26, which confirmed\r\nthat a bottom has been posted. Much of today's strength was due to\r\ncomments made by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan Sunday night that he\r\nsees few signs of inflationary pressure. Downward pressure in the fed\r\nfund futures indicates that there is nearly a 100% chance that the\r\nFederal Reserve Board will raise interest rates by 25- basis points\r\nat the June 26-27 meeting. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling\r\nthat sideways to higher prices into early-June are possible. If the\r\nrally continues, May's high crossing at 102-22 is September's next\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nThe CRB INDEX posted a potential downside reversal on Monday due to\r\nweakness in grains, meats, precious metals, fiber and crude oil\r\nproducts. Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's\r\nbearish reversal pattern. The rebound off last week's low that spiked\r\nbelow April's low was to be expected due to light short covering.\r\nCloses below last week's low crossing at 208.43 would confirm a\r\ndownside breakout of this spring's trading range thereby renewing its\r\ndecline off January's high.\r\n\r\nENERGY MARKETS were mostly lower on Monday despite the fact that Iraq\r\nmade good on its threat to cut oil exports unless it receives a\r\nsix-month extension of the oil-for-food deal. The late-session sell\r\noff was triggered by questions over Iraq's resolve to halt crude oil\r\nexports for any significant length of time.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil closed higher on Monday but near session lows as early\r\nstrength faded into the close. If the decline off May's high\r\ncontinues, the 50% retracement level of the December/May rally\r\ncrossing at 27.51 is July's next target. Momentum indicators are\r\nbearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil posted a downside reversal on Monday and closed\r\nbelow the 38% retracement level of the December/May rally crossing at\r\n75.66. Closes below last week's low of 75.10 would renew the decline\r\noff May's high and set the stage for a test of May's reaction low\r\ncrossing at 74.55, which coincides with the 50% retracement level of\r\nthis spring's rally.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas posted a huge key reversal down on Monday despite\r\nnews that Iraq has halted crude oil exports. However, today's action\r\nindicates that traders do not believe that the crude oil embargo by\r\nIraq will have long- lasting effects on the market. In recent\r\nweeks-unleaded gasoline supplies have risen enough to temper concerns\r\nover summer gasoline supplies. Additional weakness on Tuesday along\r\nwith a close below 90.30 would renew July's decline off May's high\r\nthereby opening the door for a possible test of April's gap crossing\r\nat 87.25 later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas closed higher on Monday due weather\r\nforecasts, which are calling for above normal temps across Texas this\r\nweek along with revised predictions for warmer weather in July and\r\nAugust. Additional support came from indications that industrial\r\ndemand is on the rise following this spring's decline. Momentum\r\nindicators are oversold hinting that a short covering bounce is\r\npossible during the first half of June.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES The September Dollar managed to close higher on Monday\r\nafter early weakness failed to fill last week's gap at 118.62.\r\nAdditional strength on Tuesday would set the stage for a possible\r\ntest of weekly resistance that crosses at 121.58 later this month.\r\nThe daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that\r\nadditional weakness is possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc closed slightly lower on Monday hinting\r\nthat the corrective bounce off last week's low might be ending. The\r\nrecent breakout below support crossing at .5643 has opened the door\r\nfor a test of weekly support crossing at .5508 later this month. The\r\ndaily ADX (a trend- following indicator) remains in a bearish trend\r\nmode.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar posted a quiet inside day with a lower\r\nclose due to light profit taking on Monday. September remains poised\r\nto test trading range resistance crossing at .6541. Multiple closes\r\nabove this resistance level are needed to confirm a breakout and\r\nrenew the rally off April's low. Momentum indicators are bullish\r\nsignaling that sideways to higher prices during the first half of\r\nJune are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen was lower on Monday due to light profit\r\ntaking. However, it remains above trading range resistance crossing\r\nat .8425 thereby leaving the door open for additional gains\r\nnear-term. If the rally continues, gap resistance crossing at .8625\r\nis September's next target. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling\r\nthat additional gains are possible.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS August gold closed lower on Monday as it is poised to\r\nrenew its decline off May's high. Last week's trendline breakout has\r\nopened the door for additional weakness near-term with the reaction\r\nlow crossing at 263.20 being the next likely target. Stochastics and\r\nRSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible.\r\n\r\nJuly silver resumed its decline on Monday and is poised to test May's\r\nlow at 4.315 later this week. Multiple closes below this support\r\nlevel would confirm a breakout and open the door for a likely test of\r\nweekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month. Momentum indicators\r\nare bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is likely.\r\n\r\nJuly copper closed steady on Monday following a spike below May's low\r\nat 74.75 earlier in the session. A short covering bounce ahead of the\r\nclose erased early session lows leaving the door open for additional\r\nshort covering on Tuesday. Multiple closes below today's low would\r\nconfirm a breakout of this spring's trading range while opening the\r\ndoor for a test of weekly support crossing at 74.10 later this month.\r\nMomentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower\r\nprices near-term are possible.\r\n\r\nGRAINS July corn posted an inside day with a lower close. Weakness\r\nwas tied to forecast that call for warmer and dryer weather\r\nconditions across the Midwest later this week. Additional pressure\r\ncame from spillover selling from wheat and today's disappointing\r\nexport inspection report that came in at 17.595 verses 32.383 million\r\nbushels. However, losses were limited due to expectations for a\r\ndecline in this afternoon's crop conditions report due to the\r\ncool/wet weather, which continues to dominate Midwest weather. The\r\nlatest condition report shows that 7% is rated poor/very poor, 29% is\r\nfair, and 64% is rated good/excellent. This is a decline from last\r\nweek's levels and should provide light support in overnight trade and\r\npossibly on Tuesday. Last week's breakout above May's downtrend line\r\nsignals that a short-term bottom has been posted. If the rebound\r\ncontinues, May's high at 2.11 1/2 is July's next upside target.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat plunged lower on Monday filling last Friday's gap and\r\nerasing over half of last week's gains due to improving weather\r\nconditions across the Plains. Warmer and drier conditions are\r\nexpected to speed up the winter wheat harvest while rain is\r\nforecasted for Montana and western Canada, which have been dry.\r\nMoisture is also forecasted for dry parts of China this week. Today's\r\nsell off took much of the wind out of the bulls sails as the market\r\nhas been unable to clear May's downtrend line, which is needed to\r\nconfirm that a short-term bottom is in place. This afternoon's crop\r\ncondition report showed that 25% is rated poor/very poor, 36% is\r\nfair, and 39% is rated good/excellent. This is a decline from last\r\nweek's level and could lead to a short covering bounce on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed lower on Monday however, a short\r\ncovering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses.\r\nSession lows spiked below broken trading range resistance as the\r\nmarket rechecked the recent breakout. Momentum indicators remain\r\nbullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during the first\r\nhalf of June is still possible. If the rally continues, March's high\r\ncrossing at 4.77 3/4 is July's next target. This afternoon's planting\r\nprogress report showed that 80% of the soybean crop has been planted\r\ncompared with the five-year average of 75%. The condition report\r\nshowed that 10% is rated poor/very poor, 34% is rated fair, and 56%\r\nis rated good/excellent. I am look for July to trade steady to higher\r\non Tuesday.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal posted an upside reversal on Monday as the market\r\ncontinues to consolidate in a relatively narrow trading range. Closes\r\nabove 168 or below 159.60 are needed to clear up near-term direction\r\nin the market. Strong domestic and export demand continues to offset\r\nbearish weather forecast for the Midwest and portions of China.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK August hogs posted an inside day with a lower close on\r\nMonday due to light profit taking as it consolidated some of last\r\nweek's gains. Nevertheless, the door remains open for a test of\r\nApril's high crossing at 65.95 later this month. Much of today's\r\npressure was due to spillover selling from the limit-down close in\r\nbellies. Losses were limited due to the steady to 75-cent higher cash\r\nbids. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to\r\nhigher prices into early-June are possible.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed lower on Monday on ideas that cash and boxed\r\nbeef markets may be topping. The relatively low volume of cash sales\r\nlast week indicates that there might be a larger showlist this week.\r\nMomentum indicators are bullish but have become overbought warning\r\ntraders to use caution as a top may be near. While the door is still\r\nopen for a possible test of this year's high crossing at 75.00,\r\nadditional weakness on Tuesday could trigger a round of\r\nlong-liquidation.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Monday as it posted a key\r\nreversal up due to short covering. Today's rally was triggered by\r\ntalk of possible cold weather moving into Brazil's coffee growing\r\nregions later this week. Additional support came from the latest\r\ncommitments of trader's report, which showed that funds had\r\nsignificantly reduced their long positions. Additional strength on\r\nTuesday is needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed lower on Monday as it extended last week's breakout\r\nbelow trading range support crossing at 955. Momentum indicators\r\nremain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible. If the\r\ndecline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862 is July's next\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday's short\r\ncovering bounce off the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally\r\ncrossing at 857. While another day or two of consolidation is\r\npossible, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways\r\nto lower prices are still possible. If the decline continues, fib\r\nsupport crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton posted a key reversal down on Monday but remains above\r\npsychological support crossing at 40-cents. Early support came from\r\nnews of increasing crop losses across west Texas cotton due to\r\nflooding. However, early strength failed to trigger follow-through\r\nbuying, which triggered a technical sell off into the close.\r\nAdditional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's bearish\r\nreversal pattern, which could lead to a resumption of this spring's\r\ndecline later this month.\r\n\r\nDaily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\r\nINO.com's end-of-day charting software for Futures, Futures\r\nOptions and Optionable Stocks. http://www.globalcharts.com\r\nSearch the INO Store  - http://store.ino.com/\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nT O P   N E W S\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSTOCKS\r\n\r\nJapan Stocks Review: Nikkei up 0.4% in directionless quiet trade\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25632\r\nAdd1: US Equities Review: Modestly higher in thin trade\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25630\r\nUK Stocks Review: Strong oils, Marconi takeover talks boost FTSE\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25638\r\n\r\nFOREX\r\n\r\nUS FX Review: Euro resumes losses as ECB intervention is nixed\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25634\r\nAsia FX Review: EUR/JPY buying supports USD/JPY and EUR/USD\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25631\r\nEurope FX Review: Euro hand back modest gains\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25633\r\n\r\nCREDIT\r\n\r\nUS Credit Review: Bond up after Greenspan's tame inflation view\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25629\r\nEurope Credit Review: Mkt holiday limits reaction to Greenspan\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25635\r\nJapan Credit Review: June near flat in slow, choppy trades\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25637\r\n\r\nCOMMODITIES\r\n\r\nUS Futures Summary: Gasoline, juice, wheat dive; natural gas up\r\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25636\r\n\r\nEXCHANGES\r\n\r\nToronto Stock Exchange Fines Yorkton Securities\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24516\r\nTGE Appoints New Executive Managing Director\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24515\r\nNYBOT Announces Cotton Futures Delivery Specification Changes\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24514\r\nFloor Broker Charged With Violating 1999 CFTC Order\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24513\r\nCBOT's May Trading Volume Rises 18.6% From April\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24512\r\nLIFFE Year-To-Date Value Up 52%\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24511\r\nPhiladelphia Sets Options And Sectors Index Records\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24510\r\nNasdaq Europe's Trading System Starting June 8\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24509\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nE X T R E M E   F U T U R E S\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nUpdated every 10 minutes around the clock.\r\nMore at http://quotes.ino.com/analysis/extremes/futures/\r\n\r\nWINNERS\r\n\r\nNGN1   Henry Hub Natural Gas Jul 2001              4.069     0.150  +3.82\r\nLBF2   Random Length Lumber Jan 2002              313.00     10.00  +3.30\r\nKCN1   Coffee 'C' Jul 2001                         59.45      1.65  +2.85\r\nZM1    U.S. Treasury 6% Bond Jun 2001          103 184/256   2 15/32  +2.44\r\nDAV1   BFP Milk Oct 2001                           14.75      0.35  +2.43\r\nRRN1   Rough Rice Jul 2001                         5.920     0.140  +2.42\r\nHOX2   Heating Oil Nov 2002                       0.7038    0.0161  +2.29\r\nSBH3   Sugar #11 World Mar 2003                     7.51      0.15  +2.02\r\nHUK2   New York Harbor Unleaded Gasoline May 20    0.8256    0.0150  +1.81\r\nSIF2   Silver Jan 2002                             4.424     0.070  +1.55\r\n\r\nLOSERS\r\n\r\nPBN1   Frozen Pork Bellies Jul 2001               79.175    -3.000  -3.65\r\nOJN1   Orange Juice Froz.

extended last\r Friday s short covering rallies Light support came from biotech\r stocks however trading was rather light Session highs in the\r September S P 500 index fell short of filling last Wednesday s gap at\r 1278 50 as the rebound off last week s low still appears corrective\r in nature Meanwhile, the Nasdaq did fill last week s gap but closed\r below the opening range leaving the door open for a possible setback\r on Tuesday Momentum indicators remain bearish hinting that\r additional weakness near term is possible If the declines resume,\r May s reaction lows are potential targets \r The Dow managed to close higher on Monday led by gains in oil stock\r thereby confirming last Friday s key reversal up If the Dow can post\r a higher weekly close it could set the stage for a resumption of this\r spring s rally later this month \r INTEREST RATES September bonds extended last week s breakout above\r this spring s downtrend line crossing near 100 26, which confirmed\r that a bottom has been posted Much of today s strength was due to\r comments made by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan Sunday night that he\r sees few signs of inflationary pressure Downward pressure in the fed\r fund futures indicates that there is nearly a 100 chance that the\r Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates by 25 basis points\r at the June 26 27 meeting Momentum indicators are bullish signaling\r that sideways to higher prices into early June are possible If the\r rally continues, May s high crossing at 102 22 is September s next\r target \r The CRB INDEX posted a potential downside reversal on Monday due to\r weakness in grains, meats, precious metals, fiber and crude oil\r products Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today s\r bearish reversal pattern The rebound off last week s low that spiked\r below April s low was to be expected due to light short covering \r Closes below last week s low crossing at 208 43 would confirm a\r downside breakout of this spring s trading range thereby renewing its\r decline off January s high \r ENERGY MARKETS were mostly lower on Monday despite the fact that Iraq\r made good on its threat to cut oil exports unless it receives a\r six month extension of the oil for food deal The late session sell\r off was triggered by questions over Iraq s resolve to halt crude oil\r exports for any significant length of time \r July crude oil closed higher on Monday but near session lows as early\r strength faded into the close If the decline off May s high\r continues, the 50 retracement level of the December May rally\r crossing at 27 51 is July s next target Momentum indicators are\r bearish signaling that additional weakness near term is possible \r July heating oil posted a downside reversal on Monday and closed\r below the 38 retracement level of the December May rally crossing at\r 75 66 Closes below last week s low of 75 10 would renew the decline\r off May s high and set the stage for a test of May s reaction low\r crossing at 74 55, which coincides with the 50 retracement level of\r this spring s rally \r July unleaded gas posted a huge key reversal down on Monday despite\r news that Iraq has halted crude oil exports However, today s action\r indicates that traders do not believe that the crude oil embargo by\r Iraq will have long lasting effects on the market In recent\r weeks unleaded gasoline supplies have risen enough to temper concerns\r over summer gasoline supplies Additional weakness on Tuesday along\r with a close below 90 30 would renew July s decline off May s high\r thereby opening the door for a possible test of April s gap crossing\r at 87 25 later this month \r July Henry Hub natural gas closed higher on Monday due weather\r forecasts, which are calling for above normal temps across Texas this\r week along with revised predictions for warmer weather in July and\r August Additional support came from indications that industrial\r demand is on the rise following this spring s decline Momentum\r indicators are oversold hinting that a short covering bounce is\r possible during the first half of June \r CURRENCIES The September Dollar managed to close higher on Monday\r after early weakness failed to fill last week s gap at 118 62 \r Additional strength on Tuesday would set the stage for a possible\r test of weekly resistance that crosses at 121 58 later this month \r The daily ADX a trend following indicator is bullish signaling that\r additional weakness is possible \r The September Swiss Franc closed slightly lower on Monday hinting\r that the corrective bounce off last week s low might be ending The\r recent breakout below support crossing at 5643 has opened the door\r for a test of weekly support crossing at 5508 later this month The\r daily ADX a trend following indicator remains in a bearish trend\r mode \r The September Canadian Dollar posted a quiet inside day with a lower\r close due to light profit taking on Monday September remains poised\r to test trading range resistance crossing at 6541 Multiple closes\r above this resistance level are needed to confirm a breakout and\r renew the rally off April s low Momentum indicators are bullish\r signaling that sideways to higher prices during the first half of\r June are possible \r The September Japanese Yen was lower on Monday due to light profit\r taking However, it remains above trading range resistance crossing\r at 8425 thereby leaving the door open for additional gains\r near term If the rally continues, gap resistance crossing at 8625\r is September s next target Momentum indicators are bullish signaling\r that additional gains are possible \r PRECIOUS METALS August gold closed lower on Monday as it is poised to\r renew its decline off May s high Last week s trendline breakout has\r opened the door for additional weakness near term with the reaction\r low crossing at 263 20 being the next likely target Stochastics and\r RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible \r July silver resumed its decline on Monday and is poised to test May s\r low at 4 315 later this week Multiple closes below this support\r level would confirm a breakout and open the door for a likely test of\r weekly support crossing at 4 15 later this month Momentum indicators\r are bearish signaling that additional weakness near term is likely \r July copper closed steady on Monday following a spike below May s low\r at 74 75 earlier in the session A short covering bounce ahead of the\r close erased early session lows leaving the door open for additional\r short covering on Tuesday Multiple closes below today s low would\r confirm a breakout of this spring s trading range while opening the\r door for a test of weekly support crossing at 74 10 later this month \r Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower\r prices near term are possible \r GRAINS July corn posted an inside day with a lower close Weakness\r was tied to forecast that call for warmer and dryer weather\r conditions across the Midwest later this week Additional pressure\r came from spillover selling from wheat and today s disappointing\r export inspection report that came in at 17 595 verses 32 383 million\r bushels However, losses were limited due to expectations for a\r decline in this afternoon s crop conditions report due to the\r cool wet weather, which continues to dominate Midwest weather The\r latest condition report shows that 7 is rated poor very poor, 29 is\r fair, and 64 is rated good excellent This is a decline from last\r week s levels and should provide light support in overnight trade and\r possibly on Tuesday Last week s breakout above May s downtrend line\r signals that a short term bottom has been posted If the rebound\r continues, May s high at 2 11 1 2 is July s next upside target \r July wheat plunged lower on Monday filling last Friday s gap and\r erasing over half of last week s gains due to improving weather\r conditions across the Plains Warmer and drier conditions are\r expected to speed up the winter wheat harvest while rain is\r forecasted for Montana and western Canada, which have been dry \r Moisture is also forecasted for dry parts of China this week Today s\r sell off took much of the wind out of the bulls sails as the market\r has been unable to clear May s downtrend line, which is needed to\r confirm that a short term bottom is in place This afternoon s crop\r condition report showed that 25 is rated poor very poor, 36 is\r fair, and 39 is rated good excellent This is a decline from last\r week s level and could lead to a short covering bounce on Tuesday \r SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed lower on Monday however, a short\r covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today s losses \r Session lows spiked below broken trading range resistance as the\r market rechecked the recent breakout Momentum indicators remain\r bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during the first\r half of June is still possible If the rally continues, March s high\r crossing at 4 77 3 4 is July s next target This afternoon s planting\r progress report showed that 80 of the soybean crop has been planted\r compared with the five year average of 75 The condition report\r showed that 10 is rated poor very poor, 34 is rated fair, and 56 \r is rated good excellent I am look for July to trade steady to higher\r on Tuesday \r July soybean meal posted an upside reversal on Monday as the market\r continues to consolidate in a relatively narrow trading range Closes\r above 168 or below 159 60 are needed to clear up near term direction\r in the market Strong domestic and export demand continues to offset\r bearish weather forecast for the Midwest and portions of China \r LIVESTOCK August hogs posted an inside day with a lower close on\r Monday due to light profit taking as it consolidated some of last\r week s gains Nevertheless, the door remains open for a test of\r April s high crossing at 65 95 later this month Much of today s\r pressure was due to spillover selling from the limit down close in\r bellies Losses were limited due to the steady to 75 cent higher cash\r bids Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to\r higher prices into early June are possible \r August cattle closed lower on Monday on ideas that cash and boxed\r beef markets may be topping The relatively low volume of cash sales\r last week indicates that there might be a larger showlist this week \r Momentum indicators are bullish but have become overbought warning\r traders to use caution as a top may be near While the door is still\r open for a possible test of this year s high crossing at 75 00,\r additional weakness on Tuesday could trigger a round of\r long liquidation \r FOOD FIBER July coffee closed higher on Monday as it posted a key\r reversal up due to short covering Today s rally was triggered by\r talk of possible cold weather moving into Brazil s coffee growing\r regions later this week Additional support came from the latest\r commitments of trader s report, which showed that funds had\r significantly reduced their long positions Additional strength on\r Tuesday is needed to confirm today s bullish reversal pattern \r July cocoa closed lower on Monday as it extended last week s breakout\r below trading range support crossing at 955 Momentum indicators\r remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible If the\r decline continues, the 75 retracement level at 862 is July s next\r target \r July sugar closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday s short\r covering bounce off the 38 retracement level of this spring s rally\r crossing at 857 While another day or two of consolidation is\r possible, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways\r to lower prices are still possible If the decline continues, fib\r support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets \r July cotton posted a key reversal down on Monday but remains above\r psychological support crossing at 40 cents Early support came from\r news of increasing crop losses across west Texas cotton due to\r flooding However, early strength failed to trigger follow through\r buying, which triggered a technical sell off into the close \r Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today s bearish\r reversal pattern, which could lead to a resumption of this spring s\r decline later this month \r Daily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\r INO com s end of day charting software

Moguls' Mountain Passport allows you to travel where you want, when you want. Let's say you want to mountain bike in Crested Butte, but you don't want to spend a whole week there. No problem. Call ahead and reserve two of your nights in the Butte, then explore the rest of Colorado at your own pace. Head over to Aspen for the Snowmass Balloon Festival and then on to Vail for some world-class golf. What ever you want to do, wherever you want to go, it's all up to you. Rocky Mountain freedom!\r\n<P>\r\nHow it all works: We have a wide selection of hotels and condos at several Rocky Mountain resorts throughout Colorado and Utah for you to choose from. You buy a block of room nights from your Moguls travel specialist.  We arrange your flights, rental car and your first night's lodging at your resort of choice. From there, it's all up to you. Having a great time and want to stay another night?  No sweat!  Ready to hit the road and try another resort? Just call to check room availability, make your reservation and you're off!  Everything is already paid for, so go where you want. If you need some help making reservations, feel free to give your Moguls agent a call.\r\n<P>\r\nChoose to stay in any of the following Colorado resorts, Aspen/Snowmass, Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, Crested Butte, Lake Dillon, Steamboat Springs, Telluride, Vail and Winter Park. As if that was not enough, you can even visit Park City, Utah. The type and quality of accommodation are also up to you.\r\n<P>\r\nAre you ready for a mountain of adventure? Give us a call today for more information or to sign up for your own Mountain Passport. 1-800-6 MOGULS (666-4857)\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.skimoguls.com/images/nl/clear.gif\" width=\"550\" height=\"1\" hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\">\r\n<div class=\"article\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title\"><b><A NAME=\"1\">MOUNTAIN PASSPORT PACKAGES</A></b></div><br>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://www.skimoguls.com/images/nl/250rafting.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain Passport Packages\" border=\"1\" align=\"right\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhen you are ready to build your own Mountain Passport, you will need to make a few decisions up front. 1) How many total nights do you want to stay? 2) What type of lodging will you want?

Light support came from biotech\r\nstocks however trading was rather light. Session highs in the\r\nSeptember S&P 500 index fell short of filling last Wednesday's gap at\r\n1278.50 as the rebound off last week's low still appears corrective\r\nin nature. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq did fill last week's gap but closed\r\nbelow the opening range leaving the door open for a possible setback\r\non Tuesday. Momentum indicators remain bearish hinting that\r\nadditional weakness near-term is possible. If the declines resume,\r\nMay's reaction lows are potential targets.\r\n\r\nThe Dow managed to close higher on Monday led by gains in oil stock\r\nthereby confirming last Friday's key reversal up. If the Dow can post\r\na higher weekly close it could set the stage for a resumption of this\r\nspring's rally later this month.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES September bonds extended last week's breakout above\r\nthis spring's downtrend line crossing near 100-26, which confirmed\r\nthat a bottom has been posted. Much of today's strength was due to\r\ncomments made by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan Sunday night that he\r\nsees few signs of inflationary pressure. Downward pressure in the fed\r\nfund futures indicates that there is nearly a 100% chance that the\r\nFederal Reserve Board will raise interest rates by 25- basis points\r\nat the June 26-27 meeting. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling\r\nthat sideways to higher prices into early-June are possible. If the\r\nrally continues, May's high crossing at 102-22 is September's next\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nThe CRB INDEX posted a potential downside reversal on Monday due to\r\nweakness in grains, meats, precious metals, fiber and crude oil\r\nproducts. Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's\r\nbearish reversal pattern. The rebound off last week's low that spiked\r\nbelow April's low was to be expected due to light short covering.\r\nCloses below last week's low crossing at 208.43 would confirm a\r\ndownside breakout of this spring's trading range thereby renewing its\r\ndecline off January's high.\r\n\r\nENERGY MARKETS were mostly lower on Monday despite the fact that Iraq\r\nmade good on its threat to cut oil exports unless it receives a\r\nsix-month extension of the oil-for-food deal. The late-session sell\r\noff was triggered by questions over Iraq's resolve to halt crude oil\r\nexports for any significant length of time.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil closed higher on Monday but near session lows as early\r\nstrength faded into the close. If the decline off May's high\r\ncontinues, the 50% retracement level of the December/May rally\r\ncrossing at 27.51 is July's next target. Momentum indicators are\r\nbearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil posted a downside reversal on Monday and closed\r\nbelow the 38% retracement level of the December/May rally crossing at\r\n75.66. Closes below last week's low of 75.10 would renew the decline\r\noff May's high and set the stage for a test of May's reaction low\r\ncrossing at 74.55, which coincides with the 50% retracement level of\r\nthis spring's rally.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas posted a huge key reversal down on Monday despite\r\nnews that Iraq has halted crude oil exports. However, today's action\r\nindicates that traders do not believe that the crude oil embargo by\r\nIraq will have long- lasting effects on the market. In recent\r\nweeks-unleaded gasoline supplies have risen enough to temper concerns\r\nover summer gasoline supplies. Additional weakness on Tuesday along\r\nwith a close below 90.30 would renew July's decline off May's high\r\nthereby opening the door for a possible test of April's gap crossing\r\nat 87.25 later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas closed higher on Monday due weather\r\nforecasts, which are calling for above normal temps across Texas this\r\nweek along with revised predictions for warmer weather in July and\r\nAugust. Additional support came from indications that industrial\r\ndemand is on the rise following this spring's decline. Momentum\r\nindicators are oversold hinting that a short covering bounce is\r\npossible during the first half of June.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES The September Dollar managed to close higher on Monday\r\nafter early weakness failed to fill last week's gap at 118.62.\r\nAdditional strength on Tuesday would set the stage for a possible\r\ntest of weekly resistance that crosses at 121.58 later this month.\r\nThe daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that\r\nadditional weakness is possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc closed slightly lower on Monday hinting\r\nthat the corrective bounce off last week's low might be ending. The\r\nrecent breakout below support crossing at .5643 has opened the door\r\nfor a test of weekly support crossing at .5508 later this month. The\r\ndaily ADX (a trend- following indicator) remains in a bearish trend\r\nmode.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar posted a quiet inside day with a lower\r\nclose due to light profit taking on Monday. September remains poised\r\nto test trading range resistance crossing at .6541. Multiple closes\r\nabove this resistance level are needed to confirm a breakout and\r\nrenew the rally off April's low. Momentum indicators are bullish\r\nsignaling that sideways to higher prices during the first half of\r\nJune are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen was lower on Monday due to light profit\r\ntaking. However, it remains above trading range resistance crossing\r\nat .8425 thereby leaving the door open for additional gains\r\nnear-term. If the rally continues, gap resistance crossing at .8625\r\nis September's next target. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling\r\nthat additional gains are possible.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS August gold closed lower on Monday as it is poised to\r\nrenew its decline off May's high. Last week's trendline breakout has\r\nopened the door for additional weakness near-term with the reaction\r\nlow crossing at 263.20 being the next likely target. Stochastics and\r\nRSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible.\r\n\r\nJuly silver resumed its decline on Monday and is poised to test May's\r\nlow at 4.315 later this week. Multiple closes below this support\r\nlevel would confirm a breakout and open the door for a likely test of\r\nweekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month. Momentum indicators\r\nare bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is likely.\r\n\r\nJuly copper closed steady on Monday following a spike below May's low\r\nat 74.75 earlier in the session. A short covering bounce ahead of the\r\nclose erased early session lows leaving the door open for additional\r\nshort covering on Tuesday. Multiple closes below today's low would\r\nconfirm a breakout of this spring's trading range while opening the\r\ndoor for a test of weekly support crossing at 74.10 later this month.\r\nMomentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower\r\nprices near-term are possible.\r\n\r\nGRAINS July corn posted an inside day with a lower close. Weakness\r\nwas tied to forecast that call for warmer and dryer weather\r\nconditions across the Midwest later this week. Additional pressure\r\ncame from spillover selling from wheat and today's disappointing\r\nexport inspection report that came in at 17.595 verses 32.383 million\r\nbushels. However, losses were limited due to expectations for a\r\ndecline in this afternoon's crop conditions report due to the\r\ncool/wet weather, which continues to dominate Midwest weather. The\r\nlatest condition report shows that 7% is rated poor/very poor, 29% is\r\nfair, and 64% is rated good/excellent. This is a decline from last\r\nweek's levels and should provide light support in overnight trade and\r\npossibly on Tuesday. Last week's breakout above May's downtrend line\r\nsignals that a short-term bottom has been posted. If the rebound\r\ncontinues, May's high at 2.11 1/2 is July's next upside target.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat plunged lower on Monday filling last Friday's gap and\r\nerasing over half of last week's gains due to improving weather\r\nconditions across the Plains. Warmer and drier conditions are\r\nexpected to speed up the winter wheat harvest while rain is\r\nforecasted for Montana and western Canada, which have been dry.\r\nMoisture is also forecasted for dry parts of China this week. Today's\r\nsell off took much of the wind out of the bulls sails as the market\r\nhas been unable to clear May's downtrend line, which is needed to\r\nconfirm that a short-term bottom is in place. This afternoon's crop\r\ncondition report showed that 25% is rated poor/very poor, 36% is\r\nfair, and 39% is rated good/excellent. This is a decline from last\r\nweek's level and could lead to a short covering bounce on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed lower on Monday however, a short\r\ncovering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses.\r\nSession lows spiked below broken trading range resistance as the\r\nmarket rechecked the recent breakout. Momentum indicators remain\r\nbullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during the first\r\nhalf of June is still possible. If the rally continues, March's high\r\ncrossing at 4.77 3/4 is July's next target. This afternoon's planting\r\nprogress report showed that 80% of the soybean crop has been planted\r\ncompared with the five-year average of 75%. The condition report\r\nshowed that 10% is rated poor/very poor, 34% is rated fair, and 56%\r\nis rated good/excellent. I am look for July to trade steady to higher\r\non Tuesday.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal posted an upside reversal on Monday as the market\r\ncontinues to consolidate in a relatively narrow trading range. Closes\r\nabove 168 or below 159.60 are needed to clear up near-term direction\r\nin the market. Strong domestic and export demand continues to offset\r\nbearish weather forecast for the Midwest and portions of China.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK August hogs posted an inside day with a lower close on\r\nMonday due to light profit taking as it consolidated some of last\r\nweek's gains. Nevertheless, the door remains open for a test of\r\nApril's high crossing at 65.95 later this month. Much of today's\r\npressure was due to spillover selling from the limit-down close in\r\nbellies. Losses were limited due to the steady to 75-cent higher cash\r\nbids. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to\r\nhigher prices into early-June are possible.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed lower on Monday on ideas that cash and boxed\r\nbeef markets may be topping. The relatively low volume of cash sales\r\nlast week indicates that there might be a larger showlist this week.\r\nMomentum indicators are bullish but have become overbought warning\r\ntraders to use caution as a top may be near. While the door is still\r\nopen for a possible test of this year's high crossing at 75.00,\r\nadditional weakness on Tuesday could trigger a round of\r\nlong-liquidation.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Monday as it posted a key\r\nreversal up due to short covering. Today's rally was triggered by\r\ntalk of possible cold weather moving into Brazil's coffee growing\r\nregions later this week. Additional support came from the latest\r\ncommitments of trader's report, which showed that funds had\r\nsignificantly reduced their long positions. Additional strength on\r\nTuesday is needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed lower on Monday as it extended last week's breakout\r\nbelow trading range support crossing at 955. Momentum indicators\r\nremain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible. If the\r\ndecline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862 is July's next\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday's short\r\ncovering bounce off the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally\r\ncrossing at 857. While another day or two of consolidation is\r\npossible, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways\r\nto lower prices are still possible. If the decline continues, fib\r\nsupport crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton posted a key reversal down on Monday but remains above\r\npsychological support crossing at 40-cents. Early support came from\r\nnews of increasing crop losses across west Texas cotton due to\r\nflooding.

week s low that spiked\r below April s low was to be expected due to light short covering \r Closes below last week s low crossing at 208 43 would confirm a\r downside breakout of this spring s trading range thereby renewing its\r decline off January s high \r ENERGY MARKETS were mostly lower on Monday despite the fact that Iraq\r made good on its threat to cut oil exports unless it receives a\r six month extension of the oil for food deal The late session sell\r off was triggered by questions over Iraq s resolve to halt crude oil\r exports for any significant length of time \r July crude oil closed higher on Monday but near session lows as early\r strength faded into the close If the decline off May s high\r continues, the 50 retracement level of the December May rally\r crossing at 27 51 is July s next target Momentum indicators are\r bearish signaling that additional weakness near term is possible \r July heating oil posted a downside reversal on Monday and closed\r below the 38 retracement level of the December May rally crossing at\r 75 66 Closes below last week s low of 75 10 would renew the decline\r off May s high and set the stage for a test of May s reaction low\r crossing at 74 55, which coincides with the 50 retracement level of\r this spring s rally \r July unleaded gas posted a huge key reversal down on Monday despite\r news that Iraq has halted crude oil exports However, today s action\r indicates that traders do not believe that the crude oil embargo by\r Iraq will have long lasting effects on the market In recent\r weeks unleaded gasoline supplies have risen enough to temper concerns\r over summer gasoline supplies Additional weakness on Tuesday along\r with a close below 90 30 would renew July s decline off May s high\r thereby opening the door for a possible test of April s gap crossing\r at 87 25 later this month \r July Henry Hub natural gas closed higher on Monday due weather\r forecasts, which are calling for above normal temps across Texas this\r week along with revised predictions for warmer weather in July and\r August Additional support came from indications that industrial\r demand is on the rise following this spring s decline Momentum\r indicators are oversold hinting that a short covering bounce is\r possible during the first half of June \r CURRENCIES The September Dollar managed to close higher on Monday\r after early weakness failed to fill last week s gap at 118 62 \r Additional strength on Tuesday would set the stage for a possible\r test of weekly resistance that crosses at 121 58 later this month \r The daily ADX a trend following indicator is bullish signaling that\r additional weakness is possible \r The September Swiss Franc closed slightly lower on Monday hinting\r that the corrective bounce off last week s low might be ending The\r recent breakout below support crossing at 5643 has opened the door\r for a test of weekly support crossing at 5508 later this month The\r daily ADX a trend following indicator remains in a bearish trend\r mode \r The September Canadian Dollar posted a quiet inside day with a lower\r close due to light profit taking on Monday September remains poised\r to test trading range resistance crossing at 6541 Multiple closes\r above this resistance level are needed to confirm a breakout and\r renew the rally off April s low Momentum indicators are bullish\r signaling that sideways to higher prices during the first half of\r June are possible \r The September Japanese Yen was lower on Monday due to light profit\r taking However, it remains above trading range resistance crossing\r at 8425 thereby leaving the door open for additional gains\r near term If the rally continues, gap resistance crossing at 8625\r is September s next target Momentum indicators are bullish signaling\r that additional gains are possible \r PRECIOUS METALS August gold closed lower on Monday as it is poised to\r renew its decline off May s high Last week s trendline breakout has\r opened the door for additional weakness near term with the reaction\r low crossing at 263 20 being the next likely target Stochastics and\r RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible \r July silver resumed its decline on Monday and is poised to test May s\r low at 4 315 later this week Multiple closes below this support\r level would confirm a breakout and open the door for a likely test of\r weekly support crossing at 4 15 later this month Momentum indicators\r are bearish signaling that additional weakness near term is likely \r July copper closed steady on Monday following a spike below May s low\r at 74 75 earlier in the session A short covering bounce ahead of the\r close erased early session lows leaving the door open for additional\r short covering on Tuesday Multiple closes below today s low would\r confirm a breakout of this spring s trading range while opening the\r door for a test of weekly support crossing at 74 10 later this month \r Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower\r prices near term are possible \r GRAINS July corn posted an inside day with a lower close Weakness\r was tied to forecast that call for warmer and dryer weather\r conditions across the Midwest later this week Additional pressure\r came from spillover selling from wheat and today s disappointing\r export inspection report that came in at 17 595 verses 32 383 million\r bushels However, losses were limited due to expectations for a\r decline in this afternoon s crop conditions report due to the\r cool wet weather, which continues to dominate Midwest weather The\r latest condition report shows that 7 is rated poor very poor, 29 is\r fair, and 64 is rated good excellent This is a decline from last\r week s levels and should provide light support in overnight trade and\r possibly on Tuesday Last week s breakout above May s downtrend line\r signals that a short term bottom has been posted If the rebound\r continues, May s high at 2 11 1 2 is July s next upside target \r July wheat plunged lower on Monday filling last Friday s gap and\r erasing over half of last week s gains due to improving weather\r conditions across the Plains Warmer and drier conditions are\r expected to speed up the winter wheat harvest while rain is\r forecasted for Montana and western Canada, which have been dry \r Moisture is also forecasted for dry parts of China this week Today s\r sell off took much of the wind out of the bulls sails as the market\r has been unable to clear May s downtrend line, which is needed to\r confirm that a short term bottom is in place This afternoon s crop\r condition report showed that 25 is rated poor very poor, 36 is\r fair, and 39 is rated good excellent This is a decline from last\r week s level and could lead to a short covering bounce on Tuesday \r SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed lower on Monday however, a short\r covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today s losses \r Session lows spiked below broken trading range resistance as the\r market rechecked the recent breakout Momentum indicators remain\r bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during the first\r half of June is still possible If the rally continues, March s high\r crossing at 4 77 3 4 is July s next target This afternoon s planting\r progress report showed that 80 of the soybean crop has been planted\r compared with the five year average of 75 The condition report\r showed that 10 is rated poor very poor, 34 is rated fair, and 56 \r is rated good excellent I am look for July to trade steady to higher\r on Tuesday \r July soybean meal posted an upside reversal on Monday as the market\r continues to consolidate in a relatively narrow trading range Closes\r above 168 or below 159 60 are needed to clear up near term direction\r in the market Strong domestic and export demand continues to offset\r bearish weather forecast for the Midwest and portions of China \r LIVESTOCK August hogs posted an inside day with a lower close on\r Monday due to light profit taking as it consolidated some of last\r week s gains Nevertheless, the door remains open for a test of\r April s high crossing at 65 95 later this month Much of today s\r pressure was due to spillover selling from the limit down close in\r bellies Losses were limited due to the steady to 75 cent higher cash\r bids Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to\r higher prices into early June are possible \r August cattle closed lower on Monday on ideas that cash and boxed\r beef markets may be topping The relatively low volume of cash sales\r last week indicates that there might be a larger showlist this week \r Momentum indicators are bullish but have become overbought warning\r traders to use caution as a top may be near While the door is still\r open for a possible test of this year s high crossing at 75 00,\r additional weakness on Tuesday could trigger a round of\r long liquidation \r FOOD FIBER July coffee closed higher on Monday as it posted a key\r reversal up due to short covering Today s rally was triggered by\r talk of possible cold weather moving into Brazil s coffee growing\r regions later this week Additional support came from the latest\r commitments of trader s report, which showed that funds had\r significantly reduced their long positions Additional strength on\r Tuesday is needed to confirm today s bullish reversal pattern \r July cocoa closed lower on Monday as it extended last week s breakout\r below trading range support crossing at 955 Momentum indicators\r remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible If the\r decline continues, the 75 retracement level at 862 is July s next\r target \r July sugar closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday s short\r covering bounce off the 38 retracement level of this spring s rally\r crossing at 857 While another day or two of consolidation is\r possible, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways\r to lower prices are still possible If the decline continues, fib\r support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets \r July cotton posted a key reversal down on Monday but remains above\r psychological support crossing at 40 cents Early support came from\r news of increasing crop losses across west Texas cotton due to\r flooding However, early strength failed to trigger follow through\r buying, which triggered a technical sell off into the close \r Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today s bearish\r reversal pattern, which could lead to a resumption of this spring s\r decline later this month \r Daily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\r INO com s end of day charting software for Futures, Futures\r Options and

The fishing, boating and diving were extraordinary and I took away\r\nsome interesting thoughts that I will share with you.\r\n\r\nThe fishing was productive, however, all my strikes occurred in two distinct\r\nlocations. The first area is called the hump and it is located 12.1 n.miles\r\nSouthEast of our resort. Check this out....The hump is located in 550\r\nfeet of water and is the size of a football field. The bottom comes up\r\n(hump)\r\nto just 240 feet in many places. Because of the massive upwelling (current\r\ncreated)\r\nthe food chain is alive and well. Baitfish feed on plankton and the pelagics\r\nfeed\r\non baitfish and fishermen like me prey on the pelagics. Thank God nothing is\r\nhigher on the food chain (atleast while you stay in the boat).\r\n\r\nWe caught one 20 lb dolphin on the hump and a couple of other smaller fish\r\nis just two hours of trolling. The other location is called the \"East Wall\".\r\nThe East wall is located 23 n. Miles from shore and is in 1200 feet of\r\nwater.\r\nThey call it the wall, because the bottom drops another 1200 feet within a\r\ncouple\r\nof miles.  We caught 9 dolphin highlighted by a 30lb bull dolphin at the\r\nwall in\r\njust a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nSo what lesson did I learn?\r\n\r\nI caught all these fish by narrowing my focus. What I didn't tell you,\r\nwas that I spent about 12 total hours fishing non-productive water and\r\ncaught\r\nno other fish. I think trading is often the same way; you need to put\r\nyourself\r\nin position(in the right market opportunities) to profit and then everything\r\nelse\r\ncomes easier. This is exactly the principle behind the CTS Futures Selector.\r\nYou\r\nneed to narrow your focus on the markets that have conditions conducive to\r\nprofit.\r\nWhen fishing, focus on great conditions for the species you're targeting.\r\nWhen trading, focus on trending markets. Next time I go to the Keys, I will\r\npull those GPS coordinates and focus my efforts at the Hump and the East\r\nWall.\r\nBefore you take your next trade, maybe you should check the market\r\nopportunities\r\n(Market GPS numbers) on the CTS Futures Selector?\r\n\r\nN\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nKey Technical Developments (close of 06/04)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe B. Pound could be on the verge of a major meltdown!\r\nNext target is 140!\r\n\r\nThe grains continue to search for a bottom. Don't forget the seasonal\r\ntendency for corn to rally into the July 4th holiday and then tank!\r\n\r\nThe Dow is flashing a short-term buy signal with a target of the\r\nall time high!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nOpportunity Alerts (Links to premium content)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe following are must see features on ctsTrader.com.

the bottom of this message What I learned in Islamorada this weekend This past weekend I took a trip to the beautiful Florida Keys After working hard to launch the new website, this was just what the doctorordered The fishing, boating and diving were extraordinary and I took awaysome interesting thoughts that I will share with you The fishing was productive, however, all my strikes occurred in two distinctlocations The first area is called the hump and it is located 12 1 n milesSouthEast of our resort Check this out The hump is located in 550feet of water and is the size of a football field The bottom comes up hump to just 240 feet in many places Because of the massive upwelling currentcreated the food chain is alive and well Baitfish feed on plankton and the pelagicsfeedon baitfish and fishermen like me prey on the pelagics Thank God nothing ishigher on the food chain atleast while you stay in the boat We caught one 20 lb dolphin on the hump and a couple of other smaller fishis just two hours of trolling The other location is called the East Wall The East wall is located 23 n Miles from shore and is in 1200 feet ofwater They call it the wall, because the bottom drops another 1200 feet within acoupleof miles We caught 9 dolphin highlighted by a 30lb bull dolphin at thewall injust a couple of hours So what lesson did I learn I caught all these fish by narrowing my focus What I didn t tell you,was that I spent about 12 total hours fishing non productive water andcaughtno other fish I think trading is often the same way you need to putyourselfin position in the right market opportunities to profit and then everythingelsecomes easier This is exactly the principle behind the CTS Futures Selector Youneed to narrow your focus on the markets that have conditions conducive toprofit When fishing, focus on great conditions for the species you re targeting When trading, focus on trending markets Next time I go to the Keys, I willpull those GPS coordinates and focus my

The S&P 500 added 6 to 1267, and the Dow\r\nrose 71 to 11,061, back above the important 11,000 level. But volume dried\r\nup to its lowest level of the year: 976 million shares on the NYSE and 1.3\r\nbillion on the Nasdaq. Advancers led 19 to 10 on the NYSE, and 20 to 17 on\r\nthe Nasdaq. For earnings reports, visit our earnings calendar at\r\nhttp://www.wsrn.com/apps/earnings/internet.xpl and reported earnings at\r\nhttp://www.wsrn.com/apps/earnings/ireported.xpl. For after hours quotes\r\nand news, visit our after hours trading site at\r\nhttp://www.afterhourstrading.com.\r\n\r\nAfter the bell, Comverse Technology (NASDAQ:CMVT) rose after beating\r\nestimates by a penny with 43-cent earnings, and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) rose\r\nafter reaffirming estimates.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, GoTo.com (NASDAQ:GOTO) did something that Net stocks\r\nhaven't done much of lately: the stock rose 2.57 to a new 52-week high of\r\n26. The stock has led the ISDEX off its April 4 bottom.\r\n\r\nTraders took Oracle's (NASDAQ:ORCL) announcement that it will report\r\nearnings on June 18 as a good sign, because the company did not warn.\r\nOracle gained .24 to 16.10.\r\n\r\nSemiconductor stocks were weak on a warning from Cypress Semiconductor\r\n(NYSE:CY) and concern that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will warn when it holds its\r\nfirst-ever mid-quarter update on Thursday. A downgrade to Broadcom\r\n(NASDAQ:BRCM) also hurt chip stocks.\r\n\r\nJuniper (NASDAQ:JNPR) rose 1.96 to 44.75 on optimism that it will announce\r\na new product this week. Some analysts are concerned that the next new\r\nproduct introduction may not occur until the fall.\r\n\r\nCheck Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) plunged 5.32 to 49.85 on worries about pricing\r\npressure and increasing competition.\r\n\r\nNew issue Simplex Solutions (NASDAQ:SPLX) continued to rocket, up 11 to 39\r\nin the wake of its conference call and a Robertson Stephens Buy rating.\r\n\r\nRealNetworks (NASDAQ:RNWK) surged 1.43 to 12.43 on optimism that trouble\r\nbetween Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and AOL (NYSE:AOL) could mean more\r\nbusiness for RealPlayer and less for Windows Media Player.\r\n\r\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) rose 1.20 to 20.05 on comments that it is not in talks\r\nto buy Marconi (NASDAQ:MONI).\r\n\r\nNortel (NYSE:NT) gained .59 to 14 after announcing it will reprice\r\nemployee options.\r\n\r\nMyPoints.com (NASDAQ:MYPT) rose .95 to 2.55 on news that it will be bought\r\nout by a UAL (NYSE:UAL) unit for $2.60 in cash.\r\n\r\nSome technical comments on the market: Note: We include charts in the\r\ntechnical market commentary. If you can't get the charts via the e-mail\r\nnewsletter version, try this link:\r\nhttp://www.afterhourstrading.com/column.html\r\n\r\nAnother nice day today, but the very low volume still argues for more\r\ndownside. Today through Wednesday is a possible cycle turn window, so\r\nwhichever way stocks move on rising volume this week could dictate\r\nnear-term direction. 1200 on the S&P 500 and 2000 on the Nasdaq remain our\r\nlines in the sand; above those levels, the market looks okay, and below\r\nthose levels, a retest of the lows becomes likely. The Dow (first chart)\r\ntook out both the important 11,000 level and its main downtrend line\r\ntoday, but the low volume calls the breakout into question. Critical\r\nsupport on the index is 10,750, a trendline off the March lows. The S&P\r\n500 (second chart) cleared the important 1265 level, the neckline of a\r\npotential inverted head-and-shoulders bottom, but again, the breakout came\r\non the lowest NYSE volume of the year. A move above 1275 would be a big\r\nplus, and 1254-1265 is first support. The Nasdaq (third chart) is firmly\r\nback above its September downtrend line, which is now around 2050-2080,\r\nbut the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 (fourth chart) could both be forming bearish\r\nrising wedges (the blue lines), and the Nasdaq 100 is still below its\r\nSeptember downtrend line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial report: For a free introduction to technical chart patterns and an\r\noverview of last year's action in the stock market, visit\r\nhttp://www.internetstockreport.com/guest/article/0,1785,2571_500051,00.html.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Neither internet.com nor the writers of this newsletter makes\r\nspecific trading recommendations or gives individualized market advice.\r\nInformation contained in this newsletter is provided as an information\r\nservice only.  internet.com recommends that you get personal advice from\r\nan investment professional before buying or selling stocks or other\r\nsecurities.

term direction 1200 on the S P 500 and 2000 on the Nasdaq remain our\r lines in the sand above those levels, the market looks okay, and below\r those levels, a retest of the lows becomes likely The Dow first chart \r took out both the important 11,000 level and its main downtrend line\r today, but the low volume calls the breakout into question Critical\r support on the index is 10,750, a trendline off the March lows The S P\r 500 second chart cleared the important 1265 level, the neckline of a\r potential inverted head and shoulders bottom, but again, the breakout came\r on the lowest NYSE volume of the year A move above 1275 would be a big\r plus, and 1254 1265 is first support The Nasdaq third chart is firmly\r back above its September downtrend line, which is now around 2050 2080,\r but the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 fourth chart could both be forming bearish\r rising wedges the blue lines , and the Nasdaq 100 is still below its\r September downtrend line \r Special report For

Nassda Releases Version 1.3 of HSIM with Billion Transistor Capacity; Nanometer Full-Chip Circuit Simulator Provides New Analysis and Device Support   SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Nassda Corp. today announced version 1.3 of HSIM(TM), the latest release of the electronic design automation industry's first hierarchical full-chip circuit simulator. Targeted to designers of analog, mixed-signal, memory and system-on-chip (SOC) integrated circuits, HSIM provides detailed circuit-level analysis of timing and power behavior, and signal integrity effects. This release delivers new analysis and device support along with enhanced interoperability with other design tools.   \"I want to commend Nassda for producing such a product for the memory and mixed signal industry,\" said Puck Wong of Broadcom Corp. \"This is truly a significant and substantial development for mixed-signal circuit designers. Nassda's support for Broadcom also has been outstanding. We are extremely happy with HSIM.\"   \"HSIM version 1.3 further enhances the accuracy, performance, device model support and nanometer analysis we offer to designers,\" said Sang Wang, CEO of Nassda. \"Over 80 customers are using our technology in their design flows. This commercial success has confirmed our hierarchical approach to circuit analysis for analog, mixed-signal, memory and SOC designs. This technology will become even more widely adopted by the design community as they move into geometries at 180nm and below.\"   HSIM Solves Critical Customer Issue  HSIM solves the critical issue of analyzing circuit behavior while taking into account the electrical and parasitic effects of nanometer scale silicon. Before the availability of HSIM, design teams were unable to analyze these effects with a tool that had the speed, accuracy, and capacity that was needed. In a recent benchmark, HSIM verified a 50 million transistor network processor in just over 13 hours on a 32-bit workstation with 512Meg of RAM. HSIM's ability to address critical verification issues is reflected in HSIM's dramatic rate of adoption by design teams throughout the world.   HSIM Technology  Nassda created HSIM to perform full-chip circuit simulation and analysis with accuracy within 1-2% of SPICE but at speeds three to four orders of magnitude faster than SPICE. HSIM uses a patent-pending hierarchical technology to deliver a capacity of over one billion transistors, and is targeted to both pre- and post-layout analysis of circuits.   \"HSIM version 1.3 further strengthens our leadership in full-chip nanometer circuit simulation and analysis with unprecedented performance and capacity,\" stated Dr. An-Chang Deng, President of Nassda. \"HSIM's capability of annotating both layout parasitic and device geometry information to a pre-layout netlist is essential for efficient verification and optimization of design implementations. HSIM enables first silicon success.\"   New Device Models  HSIM now supports simulation of JFETs, found in communication designs, using the same model found in SPICE simulators. Another development for designers of high-speed systems is the ability to analyze signal integrity effects with a lossy transmission line model. As well, the latest MOS device model from U.C. Berkeley for nanometer-scale devices, BSIM4, is now supported. The existing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) device model has been improved in accuracy by working closely with Nassda's customers. With each new release, HSIM continues to incorporate the latest developments from industry and academic research.   Enhanced Netlist Back-Annotation  HSIM version 1.3 provides enhanced support for the back-annotation of parasitic RC data in DSPF format, and MOS device geometry information including device size, parasitics and resistivity. Since they account for post-layout effects, back-annotation of DSPF and MOS device data is necessary for accurate analysis of signal integrity, and timing and power behavior.   New Spectral Analysis  With version 1.3, HSIM now provides spectral analysis by means of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Performed interactively or after transient simulation, HSIM enables frequency analysis of communication circuits. This new capability provides industry-standard windowing functions for conditioning the analysis data as needed by designers.   Interoperability  HSIM version 1.3 delivers improved interoperability with other design tools by providing an application programming interface (API) for working with customers' internal waveform viewers. The new release also provides a user modeling interface (UMI) to integrate customer-proprietary device models.   Pricing and Availability  HSIM Version 1.3 is now available, and is supported on workstations running Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Microsoft Windows NT/2000, and Linux operating systems. U.S. prices start at $85,000.

On the open and after the first three hours of trading it sure looked like our forecast from Friday of a trending\r\nmarket to the down side was going right. However on VERY light volume in the cash market the posture of the limited number of players was to trade sideways to up, in the last two hours\r\nof the session. Today it was told that this was the lightest trading day on the Nasdaq and the second lightest on NYSC.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here? Frankly this one is a whole lot tougher to make a call than in the past. But lets look at the technical picture and see wants painting. First the Wave traders\r\nneeded to take out 1265.00 last week. Since there bias on the market was that it failed, then the new trend was down to long term support. How we see it at least for the moment.\r\nLooking strictly at a old fashion technical forecast methodology. Today we had a conformation of a inverted head and shoulder with the right shoulder breaking out to the long side.\r\nThis formation was started 5/30 and completed today. Along with this a classic \"W\" formation. The defined high of 1319.00 on a channel breakout added credence to what we \"think\" might\r\nbe more upside momentum. And yes since our system did make a trend change to the long side we wanted to see from end of day data what may of confirmed the move.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was\r\nintroduced to \"SYSTEM TRADING\" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back I more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I also\r\nfeel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, (then why would any one sell\r\nit?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.\r\n\r\nI found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a obsevation from them on tracking systems. And I quote \"ALMOST ALL SUCCESSFUL\r\nSYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CO- NSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote. Well\r\nfolks the fact is yes it has been developed its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us and make some $$$\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a example of a client trading two full S/P contracts for the Month of May.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                              DISCRETIONARY     REGULATED-$\r\n\r\n05/02/01 BUY     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1271.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/02/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         6,575.00\r\n05/03/01 BUY     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1262.30\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          30.87\r\n05/03/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1255.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/03/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1259.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/03/01 W/T IN    MGN DEP BY W/T                                           100,000.00\r\n05/03/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         1,700.00\r\n05/03/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         3,875.00\r\n05/04/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1266.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/04/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         3,500.00\r\n05/07/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1265.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/07/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1266.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/07/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                              .00\r\n05/08/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1264.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/08/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                          500.00\r\n05/11/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1248.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/11/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         8,000.00\r\n05/14/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1250.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/14/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                           750.00\r\n05/17/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1292.20\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/17/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       21,100.00\r\n05/21/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1301.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/21/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         4,650.00\r\n05/22/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1310.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/22/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                        4,250.00\r\n05/24/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1289.80\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/24/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       10,100.00\r\n05/25/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1280.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/25/01 GVP FEE   APR CME RB&H G/UP                               3.00\r\n05/25/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         4,650.00\r\n05/31/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1257.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/31/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       11,500.00\r\n* * * * * OPEN POSITIONS * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * OPEN POSITIONS * * * * *\r\n05/31/01    2      JUN 1   IOM S&P INDEX        1257.50           50.00\r\n  IOM        2*     SETTLE    1257.40  OPEN EQUITY                 50.00*\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n         R E F C O,  I N C.

And both\r\ntechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have\r\nbeen violated regardless of where the futures are.\r\n\r\nWhat most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long\r\nas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human\r\nintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did \"today\" but\r\nwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 \"Single Stock futures\" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r\none of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will\r\nhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r\ncomputer based with there own trading programs.\r\n\r\nAgain for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r\ncontract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.\r\n\r\nCBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited\r\nStake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001\r\n\r\n - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The\r\nChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following\r\napproval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed\r\ninto law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. \"Today's\r\nannouncement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges,\" said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. \"This exciting new\r\ninitiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives\r\ntrading and risk management.\" \"The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r\nsingle-stock futures,\" said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. \"Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r\nexchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products.\" \"I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs\r\nand our members' concerns,\" said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. \"We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r\ngreat benefit to our members.\" \"Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r\nconnectivity of the futures and securities worlds,\" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. \"This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r\nefficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options.\" \"The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new\r\nproduct to our markets,\" said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. \"The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important\r\ncontributions to the success of this venture.\" The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated\r\nexchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r\nsystem. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty\r\nsaid the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate\r\ncontracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r\nselection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r\ncorporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board\r\nOptions Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r\nindexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options\r\nmarketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on\r\nindexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50Ô , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini\r\nS&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history.

YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN\r\nCONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR\r\nBROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN\r\nFUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU\r\nWILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.\r\n\r\nUNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION.  THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A \"LIMIT MOVE\".  THE PLACEMENT OF\r\nCONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A \"STOP-LOSS\" OR \"STOP-LIMIT\" ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS\r\nMAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.\r\n\r\nA \"SPREAD\" POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE \"LONG\" OR \"SHORT\" POSITION.  THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS\r\nWELL AS FOR YOU.  THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.\r\n\r\nIN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES.  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES\r\nTO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFIT TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.  THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS AT PAGE SEVEN A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED\r\nTO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.\r\n\r\nTHIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY\r\nTRADING BEFORE YOU TRADE, INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT AT PAGE FIVE.\r\n\r\nYOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS.  TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES\r\nINCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION.  FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES\r\nMAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED.  BEFORE YOU TRADE\r\nYOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS\r\nAVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.\r\n\r\nTHIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS.  YOU MUST PLACE ALL FUNDS FOR\r\nTRADING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM DIRECTLY WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal Financial\r\n93 Partridge Dr.\r\nSan Rafael Ca. 94901\r\n800 773-1713   fax 415 457-5088\r\n\r\n***********\r\nEDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

after the first three hours of trading it sure looked like our forecast from Friday of a trendingmarket to the down side was going right However on VERY light volume in the cash market the posture of the limited number of players was to trade sideways to up, in the last two hoursof the session Today it was told that this was the lightest trading day on the Nasdaq and the second lightest on NYSC Where do we go from here Frankly this one is a whole lot tougher to make a call than in the past But lets look at the technical picture and see wants painting First the Wave tradersneeded to take out 1265 00 last week Since there bias on the market was that it failed, then the new trend was down to long term support How we see it at least for the moment Looking strictly at a old fashion technical forecast methodology Today we had a conformation of a inverted head and shoulder with the right shoulder breaking out to the long side This formation was started 5 30 and completed today Along with this a classic W formation The defined high of 1319 00 on a channel breakout added credence to what we think mightbe more upside momentum And yes since our system did make a trend change to the long side we wanted to see from end of day data what may of confirmed the move For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I wasintroduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in 1994 00 and have never looked back I more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However I alsofeel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, then why would any one sellit The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is I found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine, go to page 52 in the middle of the page is a obsevation from them on tracking systems And I quote ALMOST ALL SUCCESSFULSYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS THE CO NSISTENT SHORT TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED Un quote Wellfolks the fact is yes it has been developed its just not for sale I guess traders

bothtechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes havebeen violated regardless of where the futures are What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity s and futures have there own platforms and there own systems Its been

Humanintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did today butwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame This is the secret for long term success On the E mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8 21 2001 Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will beone of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms willhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12 21 2001 As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are allcomputer based with there own trading programs Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in acontract And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year For more details on this market

Commentary \r Today price action has moved to just above a critical pivot point On the open and after the first three hours of trading it sure looked like our forecast from Friday of a trending\r market to the down side was going right However on VERY light volume in the cash market the posture of the limited number of players was to trade sideways to up, in the last two hours\r of the session Today it was told that this was the lightest trading day on the Nasdaq and the second lightest on NYSC \r Where do we go from here Frankly this one is a whole lot tougher to make a call than in the past But lets look at the technical picture and see wants painting First the Wave traders\r needed to take out 1265 00 last week Since there bias on the market was that it failed, then the new trend was down to long term support How we see it at least for the moment \r Looking strictly at a old fashion technical forecast methodology Today we had a conformation of a inverted head and shoulder with the right shoulder breaking out to the long side \r This formation was started 5 30 and completed today Along with this a classic W formation The defined high of 1319 00 on a channel breakout added credence to what we think might\r be more upside momentum And yes since our system did make a trend change to the long side we wanted to see from end of day data what may of confirmed the move \r For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I was\r introduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in 1994 00 and have never looked back I more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However I also\r feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, then why would any one sell\r it The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is \r I found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine, go to page 52 in the middle of the page is a obsevation from them on tracking systems And I quote ALMOST ALL SUCCESSFUL\r SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS THE CO NSISTENT SHORT TERM SWING

In wireless LANs for the home?\r\nIn airports? Offices? Given the times, maybe they should be\r\nlooking for opportunities in smaller markets.\r\n\r\nAfter his last company, a wireless ASP, netted him \"zero,\"\r\nMike Stemple founded a more modest wireless company. His\r\ntwo-month-old firm, Nomad Labs, installs wireless systems\r\nprimarily for zoos and aquariums. Nomad doesn't make\r\nhardware; it uses off-the-shelf PDAs and standard wireless\r\naccess devices (802.11b for now; Bluetooth perhaps later).\r\n\r\nThe idea is that visitors -- at first, only teachers and\r\nrich patrons -- borrow a wireless-equipped Windows CE\r\nhandheld from the zoo. While they're wandering through\r\nexhibits, they can look up information (including streaming\r\nmovies) from the zoo's servers, or get alerted that events\r\n(like feedings) are about to start.\r\n\r\nThey can also be marketed to; for example, to renew their\r\ndonation (useful since few zoo members ever visit a zoo's\r\nWeb site).\r\n\r\nThere are only a hundred zoos and aquariums in the U.S., so\r\nMike's upside is capped. Nomad is, however, self-funded, and\r\nis not in need of big venture money. In the future, Mike may\r\nextend Nomad's domain to other \"edutainment\" markets and to\r\ntrade shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Rafe Needleman, rafe-needleman@redherring.com\r\n  Editor, http://www.redherring.com\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPANIES\r\n* Nomad Labs\r\n  http://www.nomadlabs.com\r\n\r\n* The Denver Zoo\r\n  http://www.denverzoo.org\r\n\r\n* Symbol Technologies\r\n  http://www.symbol.com\r\n\r\n* Tour-Mate Systems\r\n  http://www.tourmate.com\r\n\r\n* Venue Tech Systems\r\n  http://www.binocssystems.com\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATED STORIES\r\n* Shop Talk: Wireless with that latte, sir?\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=50000005&doc_id=980019498&rh_special_report_id=\r\n\r\n* Catch of the Day: Invisible to the naked eye (WideRay)\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/story_redirect.asp?layout=story_generic&doc_id=RH1190019119&channel=80000008\r\n\r\n* How schools get wired without using wires\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=special_report_gen&doc_id=620015462&channel=10000001&rh_special_report_id=310000031\r\n\r\n* Bluetooth gleamed at CeBIT in 2000\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=10000001&doc_id=380012038&rh_special_report_id=\r\n\r\n* Location-based entertainment -- the next big medium?\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/story_redirect.asp?layout=story_generic&doc_id=RH1300016530&channel=70000007\r\n\r\n* The Bluetooth Report: The coming revolution in personal\r\n  networking (Red Herring Research)\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=research_abstract&rh_research_id=460018646\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n               A D V E R T I S E M E N T\r\n\r\nFind out how Oracle's Global CRM in 90 Days can save you\r\nmoney, time and resources.

On the open and after the first three hours of trading it sure looked like our forecast from Friday of a trending\r\nmarket to the down side was going right. However on VERY light volume in the cash market the posture of the limited number of players was to trade sideways to up, in the last two hours\r\nof the session. Today it was told that this was the lightest trading day on the Nasdaq and the second lightest on NYSE.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here? Frankly this one is a whole lot tougher to make a call than in the past. But lets look at the technical picture and see wants painting. First the Wave traders\r\nneeded to take out 1265.00 last week. Since there bias on the market was that it failed, then the new trend was down to long term support. How we see it at least for the moment.\r\nLooking strictly at a old fashion technical forecast methodology. Today we had a conformation of a inverted head and shoulder with the right shoulder breaking out to the long side.\r\nThis formation was started 5/30 and completed today. Along with this a classic \"W\" formation. The defined high of 1319.00 on a channel breakout added credence to what we \"think\" might\r\nbe more upside momentum. And yes since our system did make a trend change to the long side we wanted to see from end of day data what may of confirmed the move.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was\r\nintroduced to \"SYSTEM TRADING\" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back I more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I also\r\nfeel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, (then why would any one sell\r\nit?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.\r\n\r\nI found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a obsevation from them on tracking systems. And I quote \"ALMOST ALL SUCCESSFUL\r\nSYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CO- NSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote. Well\r\nfolks the fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us and make some $$$\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a example of a client trading two full S/P contracts for the Month of May.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                              DISCRETIONARY     REGULATED-$\r\n\r\n05/02/01 BUY     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1271.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/02/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         6,575.00\r\n05/03/01 BUY     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1262.30\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          30.87\r\n05/03/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1255.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/03/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1259.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/03/01 W/T IN    MGN DEP BY W/T                                           100,000.00\r\n05/03/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         1,700.00\r\n05/03/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         3,875.00\r\n05/04/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1266.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/04/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         3,500.00\r\n05/07/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1265.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/07/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1266.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/07/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                              .00\r\n05/08/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1264.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/08/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                          500.00\r\n05/11/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1248.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/11/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         8,000.00\r\n05/14/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1250.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/14/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                           750.00\r\n05/17/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1292.20\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/17/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       21,100.00\r\n05/21/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1301.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/21/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         4,650.00\r\n05/22/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1310.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/22/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                        4,250.00\r\n05/24/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1289.80\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/24/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       10,100.00\r\n05/25/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1280.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/25/01 GVP FEE   APR CME RB&H G/UP                               3.00\r\n05/25/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         4,650.00\r\n05/31/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1257.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/31/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       11,500.00\r\n* * * * * OPEN POSITIONS * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * OPEN POSITIONS * * * * *\r\n05/31/01    2      JUN 1   IOM S&P INDEX        1257.50           50.00\r\n  IOM        2*     SETTLE    1257.40  OPEN EQUITY                 50.00*\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n         R E F C O,  I N C.

And both\r\ntechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have\r\nbeen violated regardless of where the futures are.\r\n\r\nWhat most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long\r\nas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human\r\nintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did \"today\" but\r\nwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 \"Single Stock futures\" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r\none of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will\r\nhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r\ncomputer based with there own trading programs.\r\n\r\nAgain for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r\ncontract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.\r\n\r\nCBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited\r\nStake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001\r\n\r\n - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The\r\nChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following\r\napproval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed\r\ninto law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. \"Today's\r\nannouncement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges,\" said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. \"This exciting new\r\ninitiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives\r\ntrading and risk management.\" \"The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r\nsingle-stock futures,\" said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. \"Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r\nexchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products.\" \"I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs\r\nand our members' concerns,\" said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. \"We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r\ngreat benefit to our members.\" \"Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r\nconnectivity of the futures and securities worlds,\" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. \"This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r\nefficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options.\" \"The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new\r\nproduct to our markets,\" said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. \"The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important\r\ncontributions to the success of this venture.\" The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated\r\nexchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r\nsystem. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty\r\nsaid the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate\r\ncontracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r\nselection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r\ncorporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board\r\nOptions Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r\nindexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options\r\nmarketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on\r\nindexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50Ô , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini\r\nS&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history.

YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN\r\nCONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR\r\nBROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN\r\nFUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU\r\nWILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.\r\n\r\nUNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION.  THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A \"LIMIT MOVE\".  THE PLACEMENT OF\r\nCONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A \"STOP-LOSS\" OR \"STOP-LIMIT\" ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS\r\nMAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.\r\n\r\nA \"SPREAD\" POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE \"LONG\" OR \"SHORT\" POSITION.  THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS\r\nWELL AS FOR YOU.  THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.\r\n\r\nIN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES.  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES\r\nTO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFIT TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.  THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS AT PAGE SEVEN A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED\r\nTO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.\r\n\r\nTHIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY\r\nTRADING BEFORE YOU TRADE, INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT AT PAGE FIVE.\r\n\r\nYOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS.  TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES\r\nINCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION.  FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES\r\nMAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED.  BEFORE YOU TRADE\r\nYOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS\r\nAVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.\r\n\r\nTHIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS.  YOU MUST PLACE ALL FUNDS FOR\r\nTRADING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM DIRECTLY WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal Financial\r\n93 Partridge Dr.\r\nSan Rafael Ca. 94901\r\n800 773-1713   fax 415 457-5088\r\n\r\n***********\r\nEDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

after the first three hours of trading it sure looked like our forecast from Friday of a trendingmarket to the down side was going right However on VERY light volume in the cash market the posture of the limited number of players was to trade sideways to up, in the last two hoursof the session Today it was told that this was the lightest trading day on the Nasdaq and the second lightest on NYSE Where do we go from here Frankly this one is a whole lot tougher to make a call than in the past But lets look at the technical picture and see wants painting First the Wave tradersneeded to take out 1265 00 last week Since there bias on the market was that it failed, then the new trend was down to long term support How we see it at least for the moment Looking strictly at a old fashion technical forecast methodology Today we had a conformation of a inverted head and shoulder with the right shoulder breaking out to the long side This formation was started 5 30 and completed today Along with this a classic W formation The defined high of 1319 00 on a channel breakout added credence to what we think mightbe more upside momentum And yes since our system did make a trend change to the long side we wanted to see from end of day data what may of confirmed the move For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I wasintroduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in 1994 00 and have never looked back I more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However I alsofeel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, then why would any one sellit The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is I found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine, go to page 52 in the middle of the page is a obsevation from them on tracking systems And I quote ALMOST ALL SUCCESSFULSYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS THE CO NSISTENT SHORT TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED Un quote Wellfolks the fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale I guess traders

bothtechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes havebeen violated regardless of where the futures are What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity s and futures have there own platforms and there own systems Its been

starting 8 21 2001 Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will beone of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms willhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12 21 2001 As long as there are no problems

institutional firms that are allcomputer based with there own trading programs Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues For

Commentary \r Today price action has moved to just above a critical pivot point On the open and after the first three hours of trading it sure looked like our forecast from Friday of a trending\r market to the down side was going right However on VERY light volume in the cash market the posture of the limited number of players was to trade sideways to up, in the last two hours\r of the session Today it was told that this was the lightest trading day on the Nasdaq and the second lightest on NYSE \r Where do we go from here Frankly this one is a whole lot tougher to make a call than in the past But lets look at the technical picture and see wants painting First the Wave traders\r needed to take out 1265 00 last week Since there bias on the market was that it failed, then the new trend was down to long term support How we see it at least for the moment \r Looking strictly at a old fashion technical forecast methodology Today we had a conformation of a inverted head and shoulder with the right shoulder breaking out to the long side \r This formation was started 5 30 and completed today Along with this a classic W formation The defined high of 1319 00 on a channel breakout added credence to what we think might\r be more upside momentum And yes since our system did make a trend change to the long side we wanted to see from end of day data what may of confirmed the move \r For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I was\r introduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in 1994 00 and have never looked back I more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However I also\r feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, then why would any one sell\r it The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is \r I found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine, go to page 52 in the middle of the page is a obsevation from them on tracking systems And I quote ALMOST ALL SUCCESSFUL\r SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS THE CO NSISTENT SHORT TERM SWING

Texas Instruments Licenses WIDCOMM's Bluetooth for Windows Software; Agreement to Focus on High-Performance Bluetooth Designs for Notebook and Desktop PCs   MONTE CARLO, Monaco & SAN DIEGO, Jun 5, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- WIDCOMM Inc., a leader in short-range wireless communications and Bluetooth(TM) networking, and Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE:TXN), the world leader in digital signal processing (DSP) and analog technologies, today announced a licensing agreement to incorporate WIDCOMM's Bluetooth for Windows(R) (BTW) software stack in a series of advanced reference designs for Windows-based notebook and desktop PCs. Under the terms of the agreement, TI has licensed WIDCOMM's Bluetooth Protocol Software for Windows to use with a variety of TI reference designs for mini-PCI, PC cards, USB modules and USB dongle form factors. These TI reference designs provide PC OEMs, as well as contract manufacturers, a complete Bluetooth solution for notebook and desktop PCs that includes WIDCOMM's Bluetooth 1.1 certified software and TI's hardware to meet their platform-specific needs.   TI will also benefit from sublicensing rights for WIDCOMM's BTW software, a complete communications software solution that provides Bluetooth wireless technology for the Windows platform. In May 2001, WIDCOMM's BTW completed official Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) certification for compliance with the requirements of the Bluetooth Specification version 1.1, and the BTW software also supports all currently available software profiles for Windows.   \"TI is working with WIDCOMM because of their extensive software support for the desktop and notebook PC market,\" said Mark Stropoli, marketing manager, Connectivity Solutions Group, TI. \"The key to broad commercialization of Bluetooth wireless is software and hardware interoperability. Our rigorous tests have shown WIDCOMM's solution excels in interoperability performance. TI's customers will radically speed their time to market and achieve final product certification by using a fully certified Bluetooth 1.1 reference design including WIDCOMM software.\"   \"TI combines its PC connectivity expertise with the strength of WIDCOMM's software stack to offer complete, highly interoperable, high-performance Bluetooth solutions for notebook and desktop computers,\" commented Andreas Malzach, WIDCOMM VP of marketing and general manager of WIDCOMM Europe. \"Licensing WIDCOMM software to complement the excellence of TI hardware development speaks highly of the stability and maturity of our BTW solution.\"   About Texas Instruments  Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal processing and analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet age.

May NAPM non-manufacturing index.\r\n\r\nKEY HEADLINES:\r\n\r\nFed.'s Kelley to resign after one of two vacant board seats were\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nUS May layoff's at 80,140, down 52% from April, Challenger said.\r\n\r\nArgentina concludes mega debt swap for record $29.5 billion.\r\n\r\nChicago Fed.'s auto symposium participant's see 2001 GDP growth at\r\n2.0%.\r\n\r\nUS oil refiners raise second-quarter earnings estimates.\r\n\r\nCrude oil prices rise as Iraq halts exports.\r\n\r\nPeru's Toledo to name Cabinet and economic team soon.\r\n\r\nThe STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS\r\n\r\nThe NASDAQ and S&P 500 were mixed overnight in thin trade amidst a\r\nlack of any real economic or corporate news. Nevertheless, a number\r\nof short-term momentum indicators are beginning to turn neutral to\r\nbullish hinting that the setback from May's highs might be coming to\r\nan end. Meanwhile, the Dow confirmed last Friday's key reversal up\r\nthereby increasing the odds that the setback from May's high might be\r\nending. Monday's rally was enough to turn a number of momentum\r\nindicators neutral to bullish. A higher weekly close for the Dow\r\nwould increase the odds that this spring's rally is resuming. If the\r\ndecline off May's high resumes, May's reaction low crossing at\r\n10,774.10 is the Dow's next target.\r\n\r\nEuropean markets were lower in overnight trading while trading volume\r\nwas light. The UK FTSE-100 was down 6.90 points at 5849.60 while the\r\nGerman DAX-30 was down 13.24 points at 6164.50 as of 11:00 BST.\r\n\r\nThe Nikkei was lower overnight and briefly traded below the 13,000\r\nlevel for the first time since April 11 before a short covering\r\nbounce tempered some of its losses. High-technology stocks continued\r\nto lead the decline due to earnings concerns. Losses were tempered\r\ndue to mild strength in banking stocks. The Nikkei extended its\r\ndecline off May's high as it tested the 50% retracement level\r\ncrossing at 12,995. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming\r\noversold hinting that a short-term bottom might be in or near. The\r\nNikkei closed down 130 points to 13,182 overnight.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES\r\n\r\nSeptember bonds were lower overnight on light position adjustment\r\nhowever, market flow was very thin due to a lack of fresh news to\r\ntrade off of. Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that\r\nsideways to higher prices into early-June are possible. I am looking\r\nfor a steady to lower close on Tuesday as September bonds consolidate\r\nsome of its recent gains and trendline breakout. A setback to test\r\nbroken fib support crossing at 99-31 is a possible target today.\r\n\r\nThe German bond market or Bunds were higher overnight driven by\r\nspeculation that central banks might step into the foreign exchange\r\nmarket to support the euro. The June Bunds were last up 0.12 at\r\n106.58.\r\n\r\nJapanese government bonds rallied ahead of the lead June contract's\r\nexpiry date on June 11. The lead June 10-year JGB futures closed at\r\n140.78 yen, up 0.25 as of 1520 JT.\r\n\r\nThe ENERGY MARKETS were mixed in overnight trading. Gains in crude\r\noil were limited following OPEC's minister's assurances that the\r\ncartel would make up any shortfall in output following Iraq's\r\ndecision to halt oil exports due to a tiff with the UN over the\r\noil-for- food program. Trading could be subdued ahead of this week's\r\nAPI data. Pre-report estimates indicate the trade is looking for\r\ncrude oil supplies to drop 1 to 3 million barrels last week. Gasoline\r\nstocks are expected to rise 1.8 to 2.3 million barrels and distillate\r\nstocks are expected to rise 0.7 to 2 million barrels.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil was slightly lower overnight as it is working on a\r\npotential inside day. Overnight losses led to a move below the 38%\r\nretracement level of this year's rally crossing at 28.26. Closes\r\nbelow last week's low at 27.55 could lead to a test of April's\r\nreaction low crossing at 27.25 later this month. Momentum indicators\r\nare bearish but nearing their respective oversold zones warning\r\ntraders to use caution as a short-term bottom might be near.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil was higher overnight due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's downside reversal. July continues to consolidate\r\nbelow broken trendline support thereby leaving the door open for a\r\ntest of May's reaction low crossing at 74.55 later this month.\r\nMomentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold warning bears\r\nto use caution as a low might be near.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas was higher overnight due to light short covering as\r\nit consolidated some of Monday's sharp loss. Additional weakness\r\nduring the day session is needed to confirm Monday's key reversal\r\ndown. Closes below last Thursday's low crossing at 90.30 would signal\r\nthe resumption of the decline off May's high. Momentum indicators\r\nremain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices near-term are\r\nstill possible.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas was higher overnight as it extends its\r\nshort covering rally off last week's low. Short-term momentum\r\nindicators have turned neutral to bullish signaling that additional\r\nshort covering during the first half of June is possible. If the\r\nrebound continues, trendline resistance crossing near 4.20 then May's\r\nhigh at 4.765 are potential targets.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES\r\n\r\nThe September Euro was lower overnight despite rumors of central bank\r\nintervention to support the currency. A short covering bounce in late\r\novernight trade tempered some of the euro's losses, which could lead\r\nto sideways trading during the day session. It will take closes above\r\nlast week's high crossing at 85.70 to temper the near-term bearish\r\noutlook in the market. If the decline continues, a test of last\r\nOctober's lows crossing at 83.77 is possible later this month.\r\n\r\nThe September British Pound was sharply lower overnight as it posted\r\na new contract low. Multiple closes below last fall's low crossing at\r\n1.4072 would confirm the breakout thereby signaling the resumption of\r\nthis year's decline. Momentum indicators have turned bearish with\r\nthis week's decline signaling lower prices during the first half of\r\nJune are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc was slightly higher overnight as it is\r\nworking on an inside day as it continues to rebound off last week's\r\ncontract lows. It would take closes above last Wednesday's high of\r\n.5644 to temper the bearish outlook in the market. Until then, the\r\ndoor is open for a test of weekly support crossing at .5488 later\r\nthis month following last week's breakout below last October's low\r\ncrossing at .5643. The ADX (a trend-following indicator) is bearish\r\nsignaling that additional weakness is possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight following Monday's\r\ninside day with a lower close. September remains poised to test of\r\nMay's high crossing at .6541. Closes above .6541 are needed to\r\nconfirm an upside breakout of May's trading range thereby renewing\r\nthis spring's rally. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that\r\nsideways to higher prices during the first half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen was lower overnight and is working on a\r\npotential key reversal down due to profit taking. If last week's gap\r\ncrossing at .8425 is filled, it would temper the bullish outlook in\r\nthe yen. Closes above last week's high crossing at .8533 are needed\r\nto keep bulls in control of the market. Stochastics and RSI are\r\nbullish but nearing their respective overbought zones warning\r\ntrader's to use caution as a short-term top might be near.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS\r\n\r\nAugust comex gold is working on a possible upside reversal in\r\novernight trading. August continues to consolidate around the 75%\r\nretracement level of the decline off May's high, which crosses at\r\n267.20. If the decline continues, the reaction low crossing at 263.20\r\nis August's next target. Stochastics and RSI are bearish but becoming\r\noversold warning bears not to press their hand as a low may be near.\r\n\r\nJuly silver was higher overnight due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's sell off. However, the door remains open for a\r\ntest of trading range support crossing at 4.31. Momentum indicators\r\nare bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.\r\nMultiple closes below the lower boundary of this spring's trading\r\nrange crossing at 4.31 would open the door for a possible test of\r\nweekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly copper was slightly higher overnight due to short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's spike below May's low crossing at 74.75. Closes\r\nbelow Monday's low would open the door for additional weakness and\r\ncould lead to a test of weekly support crossing at 74.10 later this\r\nspring. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to\r\nlower prices into early-June appears are possible.\r\n\r\nGRAINS\r\n\r\nJuly corn was higher overnight following Monday's crop conditions\r\nreport that showed a drop in the ratings over last week. While\r\ntraders continue to downplay the cool/wet conditions especially\r\nacross the western Corn Belt, they could not deny Monday's ratings\r\ndecline. This week's weather forecast shows only modest improvement\r\nin weather conditions leading some traders to speculate that next\r\nweek's crop ratings report will show another decline as well. Gains\r\nwere limited due to weather forecasts calling for increased chances\r\nfor precip across portions of China, which have been on the dry side.\r\nThe ongoing rally in the US Dollar is also keeping a tight lid on\r\ngrain prices as it continues to make US grain exports unattractive on\r\nthe world markets. Nevertheless, last week's breakout above May's\r\ndowntrend line signaled that a short-term bottom has been posted. A\r\nsteady to higher close on Tuesday would help set the stage for a\r\npossible of May's high crossing at 2.11 1/2 later this month. Early\r\ncalls are for July corn to open 1 to 1 1/4 cents higher this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat was steady in overnight trading following Monday's crop\r\nconditions reports in both winter and spring wheat. Both reports\r\nshowed declines in crop ratings from the previous week. Nevertheless,\r\nforecast for improving weather conditions across the plains will\r\ncontinue to keep July wheat on the defensive for the time being. I\r\nwould not be surprised to see a short covering bounce on Tuesday as\r\nJuly may try and consolidate some of Monday's losses. Early calls are\r\nfor July wheat to open steady this morning.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPEX\r\n\r\nJuly soybeans were higher in overnight trading following Monday's\r\ncrop conditions report that showed a decline in the crop ratings. The\r\ndecline was expected due to the lingering cool/wet conditions across\r\nthe Midwest. Overnight gains set the stage for a test of last week's\r\nhigh crossing at 4.60 1/2. Closes above this high would open the door\r\nfor a possible test of March's high crossing at 4.77 3/4 later this\r\nmonth. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to\r\nhigher prices near-term are possible. Early calls are for July\r\nsoybeans to open 3 to 4 cents higher this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal was higher overnight following Monday's upside\r\nreversal and spillover strength from soybeans. This week's friendly\r\ncrop conditions report along with continued strong demand could lead\r\nto a test of May's high crossing at 168. Multiple closes above this\r\nresistance level would renew this spring's rally. Momentum indicators\r\nare still bearish warning bulls that closes into new highs for this\r\nspring are needed to renew the rally off March's low. Early calls are\r\nfor July soybean meal to open 50 to 70-cents higher this morning.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK\r\n\r\nAugust hogs posted an inside day with a lower close on Monday due to\r\nlight profit taking as it consolidated some of last week's gains.\r\nNevertheless, the door remains open for a test of April's high\r\ncrossing at 65.95 later this month. Much of today's pressure was due\r\nto spillover selling from the limit-down close in bellies. Losses\r\nwere limited due to the steady to 75-cent higher cash bids. Momentum\r\nindicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices into\r\nearly-June are possible.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed lower on Monday on ideas that cash and boxed\r\nbeef markets may be topping. The relatively low volume of cash sales\r\nlast week indicates that there might be a larger showlist this week.\r\nMomentum indicators are bullish but have become overbought warning\r\ntraders to use caution as a top may be near. While the door is still\r\nopen for a possible test of this year's high crossing at 75.00,\r\nadditional weakness on Tuesday could trigger a round of\r\nlong-liquidation.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Monday as it posted a key\r\nreversal up due to short covering. Today's rally was triggered by\r\ntalk of possible cold weather moving into Brazil's coffee growing\r\nregions later this week. Additional support came from the latest\r\ncommitments of trader's report, which showed that funds had\r\nsignificantly reduced their long positions. Additional strength on\r\nTuesday is needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed lower on Monday as it extended last week's breakout\r\nbelow trading range support crossing at 955. Momentum indicators\r\nremain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible. If the\r\ndecline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862 is July's next\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday's short\r\ncovering bounce off the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally\r\ncrossing at 857. While another day or two of consolidation is\r\npossible, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways\r\nto lower prices are still possible. If the decline continues, fib\r\nsupport crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton posted a key reversal down on Monday but remains above\r\npsychological support crossing at 40-cents. Early support came from\r\nnews of increasing crop losses across west Texas cotton due to\r\nflooding. However, early strength failed to trigger follow-through\r\nbuying, which triggered a technical sell off into the close.\r\nAdditional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's bearish\r\nreversal pattern, which could lead to a resumption of this spring's\r\ndecline later this month.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTOMORROW'S MARKET PRICES TODAY\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nArmed with such information, such power, you could\r\neasily make a fortune!\r\n\r\nDo you suspect that the markets follow some pattern?\r\nThat somehow there is some order and reason to market movements?\r\n\r\nThen you'll be both intrigued and thrilled at this\r\ntremendous discovery.\r\n\r\nCALL MARKET TOPS AND\r\nBOTTOMS WITH PINPOINT ACCURACY . . .\r\n\r\nIt makes no difference what market, stocks, futures, anything.\r\nThese techniques forecast both intraday price moves and the 2-3\r\nday short-term price swings.

May NAPM non-manufacturing index.\r\n\r\nKEY HEADLINES:\r\n\r\nFed.'s Kelley to resign after one of two vacant board seats were\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nUS May layoff's at 80,140, down 52% from April, Challenger said.\r\n\r\nArgentina concludes mega debt swap for record $29.5 billion.\r\n\r\nChicago Fed.'s auto symposium participant's see 2001 GDP growth at\r\n2.0%.\r\n\r\nUS oil refiners raise second-quarter earnings estimates.\r\n\r\nCrude oil prices rise as Iraq halts exports.\r\n\r\nPeru's Toledo to name Cabinet and economic team soon.\r\n\r\nThe STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS\r\n\r\nThe NASDAQ and S&P 500 were mixed overnight in thin trade amidst a\r\nlack of any real economic or corporate news. Nevertheless, a number\r\nof short-term momentum indicators are beginning to turn neutral to\r\nbullish hinting that the setback from May's highs might be coming to\r\nan end. Meanwhile, the Dow confirmed last Friday's key reversal up\r\nthereby increasing the odds that the setback from May's high might be\r\nending. Monday's rally was enough to turn a number of momentum\r\nindicators neutral to bullish. A higher weekly close for the Dow\r\nwould increase the odds that this spring's rally is resuming. If the\r\ndecline off May's high resumes, May's reaction low crossing at\r\n10,774.10 is the Dow's next target.\r\n\r\nEuropean markets were lower in overnight trading while trading volume\r\nwas light. The UK FTSE-100 was down 6.90 points at 5849.60 while the\r\nGerman DAX-30 was down 13.24 points at 6164.50 as of 11:00 BST.\r\n\r\nThe Nikkei was lower overnight and briefly traded below the 13,000\r\nlevel for the first time since April 11 before a short covering\r\nbounce tempered some of its losses. High-technology stocks continued\r\nto lead the decline due to earnings concerns. Losses were tempered\r\ndue to mild strength in banking stocks. The Nikkei extended its\r\ndecline off May's high as it tested the 50% retracement level\r\ncrossing at 12,995. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming\r\noversold hinting that a short-term bottom might be in or near. The\r\nNikkei closed down 130 points to 13,182 overnight.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES\r\n\r\nSeptember bonds were lower overnight on light position adjustment\r\nhowever, market flow was very thin due to a lack of fresh news to\r\ntrade off of. Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that\r\nsideways to higher prices into early-June are possible. I am looking\r\nfor a steady to lower close on Tuesday as September bonds consolidate\r\nsome of its recent gains and trendline breakout. A setback to test\r\nbroken fib support crossing at 99-31 is a possible target today.\r\n\r\nThe German bond market or Bunds were higher overnight driven by\r\nspeculation that central banks might step into the foreign exchange\r\nmarket to support the euro. The June Bunds were last up 0.12 at\r\n106.58.\r\n\r\nJapanese government bonds rallied ahead of the lead June contract's\r\nexpiry date on June 11. The lead June 10-year JGB futures closed at\r\n140.78 yen, up 0.25 as of 1520 JT.\r\n\r\nThe ENERGY MARKETS were mixed in overnight trading. Gains in crude\r\noil were limited following OPEC's minister's assurances that the\r\ncartel would make up any shortfall in output following Iraq's\r\ndecision to halt oil exports due to a tiff with the UN over the\r\noil-for- food program. Trading could be subdued ahead of this week's\r\nAPI data. Pre-report estimates indicate the trade is looking for\r\ncrude oil supplies to drop 1 to 3 million barrels last week. Gasoline\r\nstocks are expected to rise 1.8 to 2.3 million barrels and distillate\r\nstocks are expected to rise 0.7 to 2 million barrels.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil was slightly lower overnight as it is working on a\r\npotential inside day. Overnight losses led to a move below the 38%\r\nretracement level of this year's rally crossing at 28.26. Closes\r\nbelow last week's low at 27.55 could lead to a test of April's\r\nreaction low crossing at 27.25 later this month. Momentum indicators\r\nare bearish but nearing their respective oversold zones warning\r\ntraders to use caution as a short-term bottom might be near.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil was higher overnight due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's downside reversal. July continues to consolidate\r\nbelow broken trendline support thereby leaving the door open for a\r\ntest of May's reaction low crossing at 74.55 later this month.\r\nMomentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold warning bears\r\nto use caution as a low might be near.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas was higher overnight due to light short covering as\r\nit consolidated some of Monday's sharp loss. Additional weakness\r\nduring the day session is needed to confirm Monday's key reversal\r\ndown. Closes below last Thursday's low crossing at 90.30 would signal\r\nthe resumption of the decline off May's high. Momentum indicators\r\nremain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices near-term are\r\nstill possible.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas was higher overnight as it extends its\r\nshort covering rally off last week's low. Short-term momentum\r\nindicators have turned neutral to bullish signaling that additional\r\nshort covering during the first half of June is possible. If the\r\nrebound continues, trendline resistance crossing near 4.20 then May's\r\nhigh at 4.765 are potential targets.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES\r\n\r\nThe September Euro was lower overnight despite rumors of central bank\r\nintervention to support the currency. A short covering bounce in late\r\novernight trade tempered some of the euro's losses, which could lead\r\nto sideways trading during the day session. It will take closes above\r\nlast week's high crossing at 85.70 to temper the near-term bearish\r\noutlook in the market. If the decline continues, a test of last\r\nOctober's lows crossing at 83.77 is possible later this month.\r\n\r\nThe September British Pound was sharply lower overnight as it posted\r\na new contract low. Multiple closes below last fall's low crossing at\r\n1.4072 would confirm the breakout thereby signaling the resumption of\r\nthis year's decline. Momentum indicators have turned bearish with\r\nthis week's decline signaling lower prices during the first half of\r\nJune are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc was slightly higher overnight as it is\r\nworking on an inside day as it continues to rebound off last week's\r\ncontract lows. It would take closes above last Wednesday's high of\r\n.5644 to temper the bearish outlook in the market. Until then, the\r\ndoor is open for a test of weekly support crossing at .5488 later\r\nthis month following last week's breakout below last October's low\r\ncrossing at .5643. The ADX (a trend-following indicator) is bearish\r\nsignaling that additional weakness is possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight following Monday's\r\ninside day with a lower close. September remains poised to test of\r\nMay's high crossing at .6541. Closes above .6541 are needed to\r\nconfirm an upside breakout of May's trading range thereby renewing\r\nthis spring's rally. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that\r\nsideways to higher prices during the first half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen was lower overnight and is working on a\r\npotential key reversal down due to profit taking. If last week's gap\r\ncrossing at .8425 is filled, it would temper the bullish outlook in\r\nthe yen. Closes above last week's high crossing at .8533 are needed\r\nto keep bulls in control of the market. Stochastics and RSI are\r\nbullish but nearing their respective overbought zones warning\r\ntrader's to use caution as a short-term top might be near.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS\r\n\r\nAugust comex gold is working on a possible upside reversal in\r\novernight trading. August continues to consolidate around the 75%\r\nretracement level of the decline off May's high, which crosses at\r\n267.20. If the decline continues, the reaction low crossing at 263.20\r\nis August's next target. Stochastics and RSI are bearish but becoming\r\noversold warning bears not to press their hand as a low may be near.\r\n\r\nJuly silver was higher overnight due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's sell off. However, the door remains open for a\r\ntest of trading range support crossing at 4.31. Momentum indicators\r\nare bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.\r\nMultiple closes below the lower boundary of this spring's trading\r\nrange crossing at 4.31 would open the door for a possible test of\r\nweekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly copper was slightly higher overnight due to short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's spike below May's low crossing at 74.75. Closes\r\nbelow Monday's low would open the door for additional weakness and\r\ncould lead to a test of weekly support crossing at 74.10 later this\r\nspring. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to\r\nlower prices into early-June appears are possible.\r\n\r\nGRAINS\r\n\r\nJuly corn was higher overnight following Monday's crop conditions\r\nreport that showed a drop in the ratings over last week. While\r\ntraders continue to downplay the cool/wet conditions especially\r\nacross the western Corn Belt, they could not deny Monday's ratings\r\ndecline. This week's weather forecast shows only modest improvement\r\nin weather conditions leading some traders to speculate that next\r\nweek's crop ratings report will show another decline as well. Gains\r\nwere limited due to weather forecasts calling for increased chances\r\nfor precip across portions of China, which have been on the dry side.\r\nThe ongoing rally in the US Dollar is also keeping a tight lid on\r\ngrain prices as it continues to make US grain exports unattractive on\r\nthe world markets. Nevertheless, last week's breakout above May's\r\ndowntrend line signaled that a short-term bottom has been posted. A\r\nsteady to higher close on Tuesday would help set the stage for a\r\npossible of May's high crossing at 2.11 1/2 later this month. Early\r\ncalls are for July corn to open 1 to 1 1/4 cents higher this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat was steady in overnight trading following Monday's crop\r\nconditions reports in both winter and spring wheat. Both reports\r\nshowed declines in crop ratings from the previous week. Nevertheless,\r\nforecast for improving weather conditions across the plains will\r\ncontinue to keep July wheat on the defensive for the time being. I\r\nwould not be surprised to see a short covering bounce on Tuesday as\r\nJuly may try and consolidate some of Monday's losses. Early calls are\r\nfor July wheat to open steady this morning.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPEX\r\n\r\nJuly soybeans were higher in overnight trading following Monday's\r\ncrop conditions report that showed a decline in the crop ratings. The\r\ndecline was expected due to the lingering cool/wet conditions across\r\nthe Midwest. Overnight gains set the stage for a test of last week's\r\nhigh crossing at 4.60 1/2. Closes above this high would open the door\r\nfor a possible test of March's high crossing at 4.77 3/4 later this\r\nmonth. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to\r\nhigher prices near-term are possible. Early calls are for July\r\nsoybeans to open 3 to 4 cents higher this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal was higher overnight following Monday's upside\r\nreversal and spillover strength from soybeans. This week's friendly\r\ncrop conditions report along with continued strong demand could lead\r\nto a test of May's high crossing at 168. Multiple closes above this\r\nresistance level would renew this spring's rally. Momentum indicators\r\nare still bearish warning bulls that closes into new highs for this\r\nspring are needed to renew the rally off March's low. Early calls are\r\nfor July soybean meal to open 50 to 70-cents higher this morning.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK\r\n\r\nAugust hogs posted an inside day with a lower close on Monday due to\r\nlight profit taking as it consolidated some of last week's gains.\r\nNevertheless, the door remains open for a test of April's high\r\ncrossing at 65.95 later this month. Much of today's pressure was due\r\nto spillover selling from the limit-down close in bellies. Losses\r\nwere limited due to the steady to 75-cent higher cash bids. Momentum\r\nindicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices into\r\nearly-June are possible.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed lower on Monday on ideas that cash and boxed\r\nbeef markets may be topping. The relatively low volume of cash sales\r\nlast week indicates that there might be a larger showlist this week.\r\nMomentum indicators are bullish but have become overbought warning\r\ntraders to use caution as a top may be near. While the door is still\r\nopen for a possible test of this year's high crossing at 75.00,\r\nadditional weakness on Tuesday could trigger a round of\r\nlong-liquidation.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Monday as it posted a key\r\nreversal up due to short covering. Today's rally was triggered by\r\ntalk of possible cold weather moving into Brazil's coffee growing\r\nregions later this week. Additional support came from the latest\r\ncommitments of trader's report, which showed that funds had\r\nsignificantly reduced their long positions. Additional strength on\r\nTuesday is needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed lower on Monday as it extended last week's breakout\r\nbelow trading range support crossing at 955. Momentum indicators\r\nremain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible. If the\r\ndecline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862 is July's next\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday's short\r\ncovering bounce off the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally\r\ncrossing at 857. While another day or two of consolidation is\r\npossible, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways\r\nto lower prices are still possible. If the decline continues, fib\r\nsupport crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton posted a key reversal down on Monday but remains above\r\npsychological support crossing at 40-cents. Early support came from\r\nnews of increasing crop losses across west Texas cotton due to\r\nflooding. However, early strength failed to trigger follow-through\r\nbuying, which triggered a technical sell off into the close.\r\nAdditional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's bearish\r\nreversal pattern, which could lead to a resumption of this spring's\r\ndecline later this month.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTOMORROW'S MARKET PRICES TODAY\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nArmed with such information, such power, you could\r\neasily make a fortune!\r\n\r\nDo you suspect that the markets follow some pattern?\r\nThat somehow there is some order and reason to market movements?\r\n\r\nThen you'll be both intrigued and thrilled at this\r\ntremendous discovery.\r\n\r\nCALL MARKET TOPS AND\r\nBOTTOMS WITH PINPOINT ACCURACY . . .\r\n\r\nIt makes no difference what market, stocks, futures, anything.\r\nThese techniques forecast both intraday price moves and the 2-3\r\nday short-term price swings.

{"raw": "Subject: ISR Morning Report - June 5, 2001\r\nFrom: \"Internet Stock Report listsupport@internet.com@ENRON\" <imceanotes-internet+20stock+20report+20+3clistsupport+40internet+2ecom+3e+40enron@enron.com>\r\nDate: Tue, 05 Jun 2001 16:53:29 +0200\r\nTo: alewis@ect.enron.com\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning Report for Tuesday, June 5, 2001\r\n\r\nhttp://www.internetstockreport.com/column/article/0,1785,1661_778261,00.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Net Stock Hits A New High\r\n\r\nBy Paul Shread (mailto:pshread@internet.com)\r\n\r\nJune 5, 2001 - It's a long way from its all-time high, but GoTo.com did\r\nyesterday what few Net stocks have done lately: it hit a new 52-week high.\r\n\r\nGoTo's (NASDAQ:GOTO) close of 25.99 and intraday high of 26.29 exceeded\r\nits September 5 intraday high of 25.25, when the Nasdaq closed at 4143.\r\nBefore that, you have to go back to May 2000 to find a higher price on\r\nGOTO. Its all-time high of 114.50 was reached in November 1999.\r\n\r\nThe reason for GoTo's resurgence is simple: the company is in the right\r\nplace at the right time. GoTo's pay-per-click search service is suddenly\r\nin demand, as search and portal sites look for alternatives to\r\nadvertising. Since last fall, GoTo has announced deals with AOL, Terra\r\nLycos, AltaVista, DirectHit, NetZero, iWon, NBCi, and Infoseek (Go.com),\r\namong others.\r\n\r\n/-------------------------------------------------------------------\\\r\n\r\n**JOB SECURITY -- CAREER GROWTH -- CHALLENGING POSITIONS**\r\nThe internet.com Careers Channel is powered by dice.com,\r\nthe leading online Information Technology (IT) job board.\r\nWhether you need to start your new job today, are\r\nsearching for your dream job, or are just wondering what\r\nyour skills are worth, you'll find the tools you need to land\r\nyour next great job. Don't wait any longer!\r\nhttp://www.internet.com/sections/careers.html\r\n\r\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------adv.-/\r\n\r\nThe Go.com win was a major coup; GoTo became the primary search service\r\nfor the Disney Internet site it had once sued for having a logo a little\r\ntoo similar to its own. But the Go.com win also symbolizes how risky\r\nGOTO's stock is. The future of Go.com has been very much up in the air,\r\nwith Disney threatening to shut it down as recently as January. A\r\ncontinued shakeout among search sites could bring GOTO stock back to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nBut GoTo has also diversified into other areas. The ChannelFusion online\r\nauction management program allows merchants to better manage their\r\nlistings on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), one of the very few Net companies whose\r\nfortunes have been unaffected by the market shakeout. It's interesting to\r\nnote that eBay and GoTo have led the ISDEX higher since the April 4\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nBut inevitably, we have to mention valuation, and GOTO stock is pricey\r\nindeed. The company is expected to lose 47 cents a share this year, turn\r\nprofitable by the end of the year, and earn 30 cents a share in 2002. That\r\nmeans the stock is trading at a 2002 price-to-earnings ratio of 87, or\r\ntwice the company's long-term projected growth rate. The company could\r\nexceed those targets, but keep a close eye on GOTO stock, which can be\r\nvolatile. The September 5 close of 23.31 should now be support if this\r\nbreakout is for real.\r\n\r\nBut in an environment for Net stocks where it's tough to make money,\r\nGoTo.com has always been about making money. And investors are taking\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Neither internet.com nor the writers of this newsletter makes\r\nspecific trading recommendations or gives individualized market advice.\r\nInformation contained in this newsletter is provided as an information\r\nservice only.  internet.com recommends that you get personal advice from\r\nan investment professional before buying or selling stocks or other\r\nsecurities.

Click below link to view today's chart:\r\nhttp://www.worldwidetraders.com/eGoose20010605.pdf\r\n\r\nPRSE:  Precise Software Solutions was in the process of making a large\r\ndouble top on the daily, right at $25 resistance.  The 200-day MA also\r\nprovided a wall of resistance at this precise level.  Huge volume on 5/21\r\n- 5/23 was also unable to break through.  It fell hard for three days\r\nbefore finding support at the convergence of it s50- and 100-day MAs.  It\r\nrallied two days with the broader markets, and closed with a bearish\r\npiercing pattern (gapped up and closed more than 50% below the mid-point\r\nof prior day's real body).  This lower high also corresponded with the\r\ndeclining 10- and 20-day MA and the sideways 200-period MA on the above\r\n60-min chart.  MACD Histrogram, OBV, and RSI are turning down.  Consider\r\nSHORTING PRSE once it trades at 22.29.  Suggested target is 19.10.\r\nSuggested stop is 22.67.\r\n\r\nTo view the chart for today's selection, click:\r\nhttp://www.worldwidetraders.com/eGoose20010605.pdf.

If you \r\nwould like to be removed from our list, reply to this email with remove \r\nin the subject line. Thank you!\r\n June 5th, 2001\r\n RealTimeTraders.com offers free real-time stock alerts throughout the \r\nday. Why pay for chat rooms and stock pickers for old news?\r\nMorning Watch List\r\nThis section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days. \r\nClick here for this morning's Watch List Stocks: http://www.realtimetraders.com/marketinfo/watchlist.asp Beyond The Numbers\r\nMarkets awaiting for some news to take a direction\r\nNow that the markets have entered the confession season, traders and \r\ninvestors are hesitating to take any positions. It is important to note most \r\nof the analysts continue to express concern about the US economy and \r\nthe quality of US corporate earnings. The cautious outlook and the \r\nuncertainty have led to range bound trading in the past few sessions. \r\nMonday all major indices finished the session slightly higher thanks to the \r\nstrength in oil and energy stocks. Dow Jones added 71 points, Nasdaq \r\nComposite tacked on $6 1/2 points and the S&P 500 index finished the \r\nsession higher by 6 points.\r\nOver the past 5 months the Federal Reserve has been aggressively \r\nlowering interest rates to boost the sagging US economy. However, \r\naccording to some analysts the effects of 2 1/2 points cut is still far from \r\nreflecting in the immediate economic reports. Now that the US economy \r\nmay be nearing a bottom, some analysts are concerned about the possibility \r\nof other economies around the globe starting to slowdown. These concerns \r\nare driving technology stocks further lower.\r\nStocks to watch \r\nSPLX - Monday morning Simplex Solutions announced its has entered into \r\nan alliance with Numerical Technologies, Inc.(NMTC) to enable design-to-\r\nsilicon support of the XArchitecture, a radical, new interconnect architecture \r\nbased on the pervasive use of diagonal routing. Atul Sharan, senior vice \r\npresident of marketing and business development of Numerical Technologies \r\nsaid \"The X Architecture has the potential to be a ground-breaking technology\". \r\nOn this news the stock gained $10.20 or 36.4% and closed an all time high of \r\n$38.20. Note that RealTimeTraders.com alerted its readers to this stock at \r\n12:14pm Monday when the stock was higher by only 3.27, and after our alert \r\nthe stock gained almost 8 points.\r\nCMVT - After the close Comverse Technology, Inc. reported first-quarter \r\nsales increased by 36% to $365 million, and net income increased by 40% \r\nto $79 million, or $0.43 per share,which beat First Call estimates by a penny. \r\nOn this news the stock traded higher by 1.70 from the closing pricing at $60.50.\r\nSector Analysis\r\nBiotech stocks continue to shine\r\nThis is one of the few sectors that have continued to trend higher since the \r\nmarkets bottomed in early April. In the past 2 months, this sector has gained \r\nover 30% and closed Monday's session at a 4-month high. Given that many \r\nof the biotech stocks are trading at or near their resistance levels, readers \r\nmay want to continued to watch this sector for the next few sessions as they \r\nattempt to break through their resistances. Some of the standout stocks within \r\nthis sector include Affymetrix Inc (AFFX - gained almost 5 points on Monday \r\nand closed at a two month high), Genzyme General (GENZ - closed Monday's \r\nsession near its all time high) and Gilead Sciences Inc.

False dawn in America?\r\n\r\n*** Pigs, chickens and deformed ducks...\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * Advertisement * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nMaking your first million isn't easy, but it's relatively\r\nsimple... it's the next 9 that are really difficult!\r\n\r\nBut with a relatively modest investment you can do it.\r\nLearn the wealth-building secrets of the Decamillionaires -\r\npeople with a net worth of $10 million or more. You can\r\nharness the secrets that many of the richest people in the\r\nworld have used to build their personal fortunes. You too\r\ncould turn a relatively small investment into a substantial\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nPlease read:\r\nhttp://www.agora-inc.com/reports/STOP/SuperRiches/\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n*** Last week Dallas Fed chief McTeer proclaimed that the\r\nstock market correction was \"overdone.\" Yesterday, Chairman\r\nGreenspan assured the nation, \"Inflation is not a\r\nsignificant problem at this moment [and] there is also very\r\nlittle in the way of short-term inflationary expectations.\"\r\n\r\n*** It is certainly comforting to know that our economic\r\nwoes are now behind us. Now that everything is settled, we\r\ncan get back to buying stocks.\r\n\r\n*** Maybe inflation is not a \"significant problem,\" but he\r\ncan be a nuisance. And like an ill-mannered guest who\r\nleaves beer cans in the planter boxes, he can make a mess\r\nof things:\r\no   Most commodity indices have been heating up since late\r\n    March.\r\no   \"Resource currencies\" like the Australian dollar and\r\n    the Canadian dollar have been rallying of late.\r\no   Long-term bond yields have been rising ever since the\r\n    Fed began cutting rates in January.\r\no   Until very recently, inflation-indexed Treasury bonds\r\n    have been outpacing conventional bonds for months,\r\n    suggesting that Mr. Market worries somewhat about resurgent\r\n    inflation.\r\no   Even Old Man Gold rose from his rocking chair to\r\n    stretch his legs for a spell before returning to the chair\r\n    for another long nap.\r\n\r\n*** And what of the Consumer Price Index itself? If it were\r\na common stock, momentum investors would take one look at\r\nthe CPI's upwardly trending price graph and start buying.\r\n\r\n*** The revelation from on high that the inflation problem\r\nis behind us boosted the Dow 71 points to 11,061 - once\r\nagain clearing the 11,000 mark. The Nasdaq managed only a\r\nsix-point gain.\r\n\r\n*** \"It is the responsibility of economists to point out\r\nfalse dawns,\" writes CLSA economist Eric Fishwick, who does\r\nnot see the sun rising on this economy just yet. Consumer\r\nspending will be a critical component of any sustainable\r\nupturn, he says. However, \"in real terms, retail sales have\r\nstopped growing [and] they are not yet contracting, which\r\nhas happened in previous cycles.\"\r\n\r\n*** Meanwhile, the sun appears to be setting in the Old\r\nWorld. Business confidence is weakening across Europe -\r\nfrom Sweden to Germany to Spain.\r\n\"French manufacturers were more pessimistic in May then at\r\nany time in almost two years as domestic and foreign orders\r\ndropped,\" the International Herald Tribune reported late\r\nlast week. The index of business confidence, as compiled by\r\nFrench statistics office INSEE, has dropped six months in a\r\nrow. As Deutsche Bank economist David Naude told the IHT,\r\n\"This is clearly a cold shower after they slightly crazy\r\nidea that France could escape the international slowdown.\"\r\n\r\n*** Inflation has risen in Europe, unemployment is up too.\r\nEconomic growth, on the other hand, is down. Europe.like\r\nAmerica.faces the prospect of a recession. And Europe, like\r\nAmerica, turns its weary eyes to Alan Greenspan, the one\r\nman who might rescue the situation. Bill has more, below...\r\n\r\n*** The euro declined 8% in May - because of the weakening\r\neconomic picture in Europe, it is believed. It now stands\r\njust a bit over 84 cents.\r\n\r\n*** Part of the problem - or advantage, depending on the\r\nway you look at it - in Europe may be that Europeans just\r\ndon't work enough. Richard Russell sites an OECD study\r\nshowing that Americans work far more hours than than Old\r\nWorld counterparts. In 1970, for example, Germans and\r\nAmericans each worked an average of about 1900 hours per\r\nyear. But last year, Americans worked nearly 2,000 hours,\r\nwhile Germans put in only 1700.\r\n\r\n*** But who's better off ? People who work less and save\r\nmore ? Or those who work harder and harder to get\r\nthemselves further into debt ? You decide.\r\n\r\n*** Have you read the \"Technology and Health\" page in the\r\n\"B- section\" of the Wall Street Journal lately? It has\r\nbecome a kind of obituary page for technology companies.\r\nLast Friday, page B2 reported that Tellabs struggles from\r\n\"worsening industry conditions,\" Hewlett-Packard's suffers\r\nfalling revenue from falling \"worldwide sales of computer\r\nservers\" and Ibis Technology \"cut its staff 14%.\"\r\n\r\n*** Investors looking for a rapid turnaround in the\r\ntechnology industry might want to take note of the latest\r\nGDP report from Taiwan. The tech-heavy Asian economies\r\nfirst-quarter report was its lowest in 26 years. Dante's\r\nInferno seems to anticipate tech stock investing in 2001:\r\n\"This way for eternal suffering. This way to join the lost\r\npeople...Abandon all hope, you who enter!\"\r\n\r\n*** According to a new study by two professors at the\r\nUniversity of Chicago, only 5% of analysts ever issue a\r\nsell signal. J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Freudenstein must\r\nbe one of the few. He warned investors last Thursday to\r\nthink twice before buying the stock of either Merrill Lynch\r\nor Goldman Sachs. The problem, as he sees it, is a\r\n\"continuing decline in investment banking activity.\"\r\n\r\n*** He didn't mention his employer. But, investment banking\r\nproduces 60% of J.P. Morgan's operating earnings.\r\nFurthermore, as grantsinvestor.com's Andy Kashdan and\r\nRobert Tracy point out, Morgan's investment banking\r\nrevenues fell 22% year-over-year in the first-quarter.\r\n\r\n*** \"If one were to build a banking behemoth from scratch\r\nwith the idea of maximizing exposure to a weakening economy\r\nand struggling capital markets,\" they write, \"the finished\r\nproduct would bear a striking resemblance to J.P. Morgan\r\nChase.\"\r\n\r\nEric Fry\r\n\r\nAnd more notes of a less serious nature...\r\n\r\n*** It was so beautiful in the country this weekend, it was\r\nhard to leave. Pierre had cut the hay in the field behind\r\nthe house and rolled it into giant bales. Squint, and it\r\nlooks just like a painting by van Gogh.\r\n\r\n*** Young animals of all species are adorable. We have baby\r\nducks, turkeys and chickens. One of the little ducklings\r\nhatched with a bad foot. The poor thing hops and scuttles\r\naround. \"I should probably put him out of his misery,\" Mr.\r\nDeshais had remarked last week. Somehow, the duckling\r\nsurvived - at least while it was enclosed in a protected\r\nspace. But now it is out in the fowl yard with about 30\r\nother ducks, none of whom have ever heard the parable of\r\nthe Good Samaritan nor ever seen a handicap parking space.\r\nThe deformed duckling was still alive when we left last\r\nnight. But nature will take her course.\r\n\r\nThere are also four little pigs in the sty. We bought them\r\nat a neighbor's farm just after they were old enough to be\r\nseparated from their mother. They were cute, too, rooting\r\naround in the yard. Of course, adult animals can be\r\nattractive too, with the right sauce.\r\n\r\n*** Pierre spent Sunday afternoon fixing his hay rake.\r\n\"Every year it is the same thing,\" he told me. \"I drive\r\nalong; then I hear a clacking noise. It is not too bad at\r\nfirst, so I wait. But it gets worse and worse. Then, by the\r\ntime I decide to stop the tractor and check, the noise\r\nceases. So, I don't worry about it... Of course, then I\r\nnotice that the rake isn't working. The noise stopped\r\nbecause the piece finally broke off....so I then have to\r\nsearch for it in the hay.\"\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * Advertisement * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nOUTRAGE!\r\n\r\nBillion-dollar drug company hides astounding discovery of a\r\nnatural cancer killer that's 10,000 times stronger than\r\nchemo - but without the side effects!

Clickety clack.\r\n\r\nThere is always a lot of 'noise' in an economy. The latest\r\nfigures, for example, show such a mixture of facts and\r\nfigures that it is hard to make sense of them.\r\n\r\nCorporations are issuing bonds at a record pace. $88\r\nbillion of them were taken up by investors in the month of\r\nMay alone. And, in early May the junk bond market had its\r\nbest week in 12 months, with $500 million flowing into the\r\nrisky investments.\r\n\r\nConsumers seem to be heeding McTeer's appeal to patriotism.\r\nCountrywide Credit reports that it funded $102 billion of\r\nnew mortgage loans in the month of April - and increase of\r\n130% over a year ago. And Mercedes Benz reported its best\r\nresults ever in the month of May.\r\n\r\nAnd there is the gold price. Down $9 last week, gold seems\r\nto be telling us that inflation is, as our Fed chief tells\r\nus, no problem. Gold stocks were less sure - declining only\r\n5% over the week.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the number of bankruptcies rose 17% in the first\r\nquarter. So far this year, 581,105 people have declared\r\nbankruptcy...up 23% from this period last year. What should\r\nyou make of that?\r\n\r\nWith all this racket, how will we know when the economy is\r\nreally breaking down?\r\n\r\nIt is hard enough to see what is in front of our very eyes,\r\nlet alone what is coming around the bend. Is the economy\r\nexpanding or contracting? No one really knows. We have to\r\nwait to find out, looking backward to see where we have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nWe don't know where we are, but most people believe they\r\nknow where they are going - towards the clear skies of\r\neconomic growth, full employment and 15% per year stock\r\nmarket growth. No need to consult a map, nor even to look\r\nout the window; Alan Greenspan is at the throttle. He's\r\nwearing his Casey Jones cap and has his hands on the\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\nAs we found out yesterday, the throttle may not be\r\nconnected to the fuel line...and the brake may be more\r\noperational in theory than in fact...but there is no need\r\nto alarm the passengers. This train is bound for glory,\r\nafter all. Get on board now...or you'll be left behind!\r\n\r\n\"With effortless adjustments to short-term interest rates,\r\nso the thinking goes,\" as Doug Noland put it in a recent\r\nbulletin, \"central bankers have both the skill and capacity\r\nto orchestrate positive and enduring effects to financial\r\nmarkets, while stimulating just the right amount of\r\nadditional demand to perpetuate a non-inflationary U.S.\r\neconomic boom. With the Fed able and more than willing to\r\nward off any financial difficulty or economic slowdown, the\r\nonly thing to fear is fear itself.\"\r\n\r\nIt is too late for business. Already fearful, business is\r\ncutting back. Employees are being laid off. New projects\r\nare being shelved - at least until excess inventories are\r\nsold off.\r\n\r\nThank God for the consumer. \"With industry already in a\r\nslump,\" explains an article at S.F. Gate, \"the only thing\r\nthat that has kept the nation out of recession has been the\r\nwillingness of consumers to dig into their pockets and buy.\r\nThat spending has been fueled by an ever-increasing use of\r\ncredit.\"\r\n\r\nBorrow, borrow, borrow, urges the Fed's McTeer. Spend,\r\nspend, spend.\r\nIt's our only hope.\r\n\r\nBut there is a limit to how much debt consumers can handle.\r\nAmid the clatter of news and facts, is a whisper of what is\r\nbeing called \"consumer stress.\" Credit counselors report a\r\n30% increase in business this year over last. Bankruptcies\r\nare increasing, as noted above. Consumers seem to be\r\n'maxing out' their ability to borrow and spend. In April,\r\nfor example, people spent $49.7 billion more than they\r\nearned. How long can this go on?\r\n\r\nWhat the Fed can't do; it won't do. It can't erase\r\ninventories, or turn a bad business into a good one. Nor\r\ncan it wave a wand and make consumers' debt balances\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nWhat the Fed can do - lower the Fed funds rate...and\r\nincrease 'liquidity' - it can be counted on to do. The\r\nfunds rate can go to zero, and in real terms, below zero.\r\nWill a funds rate of zero prevent stocks from regressing to\r\nthe mean? Will it light a fire under productivity and GDP\r\ngrowth? Who knows. But in Japan, it had no such effects.\r\n\r\nAnd liquidity? It 'has to go somewhere' is the popular\r\nexpression. But it might well go to rebuilding consumer\r\nsavings accounts...or offsetting deflationary consequences\r\nof a stock market meltdown...or, yes dear reader, even to\r\nincreasing the price of bread, houses and movie tickets.\r\n\r\nThere were those - many and famous - who urged investors to\r\nbuy tech stocks and dotcoms a year ago. But only half the\r\npopulation - the upper half by income - got to take\r\nadvantage of this advice. Consumers with more modest\r\nincomes, or perhaps better sense, did not get a chance to\r\nlose money on the tech mania. But now, they have an\r\nopportunity to do something equally stupid: They can climb\r\naboard the Fed's 'Debt Express,' Destination: Unknown.\r\n\r\nYour editor,\r\n\r\nBill Bonner\r\n\r\nP.S. What the Fed cannot do might nevertheless happen. Alan\r\nGreenspan, if nothing else, is famously lucky. It was his\r\ngreat luck to step onto the #1 Engine at the Fed reserve\r\nswitchyard after Paul Volcker had sharply raised interest\r\nrates thereby shut off the supply of oxygen to inflation.\r\nIt was Volcker who took the heat and did the dirty work.\r\n\r\nGreenspan has had a downhill run ever since.. coasting on\r\nthe slope of declining interest rates, with no inflation\r\nthreat on the horizon.\r\nMaybe he'll get lucky again.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * Advertisement * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nMake profits like 28%... 19%... 37%...41%... 125% and\r\nanother 28%.

The answer is not that\r\ndifficult, it's knowledge! Knowledge can be obtained several different ways.\r\nOne way, is the \"school of hard knocks\" which many people have honorary\r\ndegrees but no money.(I've been there, in case you are wondering) Another\r\nway, a better way, is to find someone who knows how to trade and have that\r\nperson teach you. This is certainly a better, and less costly, choice.\r\n\r\nMy name is David Duty and I started trading over five years ago after I got\r\na brochure in the mail about trading commodities. It seemed interesting and\r\nI got pretty excited about the possibilities. I ordered a course that\r\npromised everything, but delivered almost nothing. I lost $10,000 in less\r\nthan 90 days, not to mention the $5,000 I threw away on these courses. I\r\nquickly found out that I did not know what I was doing.\r\n\r\nThen, I got mad, not at the man who sold me the almost worthless courses,\r\nbut at myself for jumping into something without knowing what I was doing. I\r\nask myself, \"What's The Difference\" between someone who trades, and\r\nconsistently makes money, and what I was doing. I found the answer pretty\r\nsimple. Like I said, it's knowledge. So, I took a year off and studied and\r\nread everything I could lay my hands on. During this time, I found a lot of\r\ngood material and some that was so bad that the person who wrote them should\r\nhave been shot!\r\n\r\nI started compiling information that I deemed to be reliable, that had\r\nsubstance to it. What I found was a common thread among them. I started\r\nformulating a trading plan and put that plan into action. This time, it was\r\ncompletely different. I was trading and making money, and was only spending\r\nabout an hour a day at it, and some days, as little as 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nI then had friends and relatives who saw what I was doing and they too\r\nwanted to learn how to trade. So, I started teaching some of them how to\r\ntrade. Then, people they knew wanted to learn also, so I started teaching a\r\nclass at a local college and the rest is history.\r\n\r\nI've written an in-depth 450 page course, designed to teach you how to\r\nsuccessfully trade commodities. I have students on every continent (yes,\r\nthat includes Antarctica) and in over 20 countries. I'm also doing seminars\r\naround the world and having the time of my life doing it. My course has been\r\nrated the #1 course on the market by my students, who collectively, have\r\nbought probably every other course ever written.\r\n\r\nI also have a \"Mini-Course\" which is almost 100 pages and I would like to\r\nsend it to you FREE. That's right, for free. No strings attached. This\r\nMini-Course\", is the first three lessons in my full course, which like I\r\nsaid, is 450 pages. This will give you a very good idea of what my full\r\ncourse offers. Read it at your leisure and if you like it, and I think you\r\nwill, you can order the full course at my web-site. I've had many people\r\nwrite me and tell me that they learned more from this Mini-Course than from\r\ncourses they paid several hundreds of dollars for.\r\n\r\nI will also put you on my guest list for 30 days also. You will get ongoing\r\nlessons, live chats, access to my student only forum, full access to my\r\nweb-site, market alerts, and market analysis. Again this is free! In\r\naddition, if you would like to attend a seminar that I do, I'll give you a\r\n25% discount to that as well.\r\n\r\nTo get a free copy of my Mini-Course, just click on this link,\r\nhttp://www.davidduty.com/merchant/req_mini_course.htm\r\nand you can instantly download it.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the Mini-Course and I look forward to having you as a\r\nstudent or meeting you in person at one of my seminars. If you have any\r\nquestions, my e-mail address and phone number are below.  If you e-mail me,\r\nI'll get back to you usually within a few hours.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nDavid G.

The Globalstar phone provides a new way for people in remote locations to enjoy full office functionality.   The TAC-PAK(TM) includes all of the equipment necessary for customers to set up comprehensive worldwide command and communication operations within 3 minutes of arrival at an incident. Options available in the modular TAC-PAK(TM) system include a Pentium laptop computer, cellular voice/data system, color printer, copy machine, digital still/video camera, document scanner, Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping and directions, videoconferencing, and much more. Now with the addition of the Globalstar GSP-1600 phone, data cable and modem drivers (provided on a CD ROM), the user can establish two-way satellite communications for both voice and data.   The TAC-PAK(TM)'s compact size and portability enables customers to take full office operations to the top of a building, the middle of a lake, or to streets blocked by debris from tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other natural disasters. Typical applications for the TAC-PAK(TM) with the Globalstar phone include remote office operations, major incident management, insurance claims adjusting, petroleum exploration, natural disaster recovery, search and rescue operations, Remote Structure Inspections, and related remote communication situations.   \"Putting the Globalstar phone in the TAC-PAK(TM) represents a paradigm shift in remote communications,\" said Mark Lueker, director of advanced projects at 308 Systems. \"Prior to our relationship with Globalstar USA, what we were seeing in the field was a hodgepodge of communication technologies which were impossible, expensive, or inconvenient for the typical user to integrate and operate in the field. Our company's original goal was to integrate the traditional office operations and communication capabilities into a lightweight and fully functional communication system capable of being carried by a single person to a remote location such as a sales meeting, construction site, brush fire, oil exploration site, or disaster situation. The GSP-1600 phone is a perfect addition to our product lineup.\"   \"The TAC-PAK(TM) gives our customers more flexibility and range in making important decisions on the ground and it puts the Globalstar phone into the hands of people in the industries with the greatest need for remote communications,\" said Dennis McSweeney, vice president and general manager of Globalstar USA. \"The ingenuity of communications solutions by companies like 308 Systems is very impressive and we are proud to be part of these kinds of creative applications for the Globalstar network.\"   Globalstar Internet Access, which was launched in December 2000, makes it possible to use the Globalstar phone like a wireless external modem when away from a traditional landline or out of cellular range. The data transfer runs at 9.6 Kbps, which allows for the efficient transmission of email, images, and files. Globalstar Internet Access is available throughout North America and the Caribbean.

General Sentiment\r\n\r\nI took a week off from some R&R with family and attempted to spend as much\r\ntime as possible away from the PC and the CNBC tape. It doesn't always work\r\nout that as planned. The tech and Internet sectors suffered two down days at\r\nthe start of a holiday-shortened week and then recovered a little in the\r\nfollowing two days.\r\n\r\nNear-term conclusion: Although volume was light, the two-day rebound, plus\r\nthe up day this past Monday, indicated that traders/investors appeared\r\nrelatively optimistic as the market heads into what is historically a slow\r\nperiod for business for technology companies.\r\n\r\nThe damage from the first two sessions, however, couldn't be overcome in the\r\nfinal two days. The major averages gave up some ground in the four-day\r\nperiod with the Nasdaq Composite Index off 4.5%, the Dow 30, off a slight\r\n0.4%, while the S&P 500 slipped 1.33%.\r\n\r\nSoothing words over the weekend from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan\r\nabout inflation not being a particular and some curious comments about oil\r\nprices helped the markets extend their advance for a third straight session.\r\n\r\nOne remark Greenspan made was particularly interesting: The past three\r\nrecessions (73-74, 81-82, 90-91) have been preceded by a spike in crude oil\r\nprices. The Fed chief, however, didn't discuss at length the impact of an\r\ninverted yield curve. From a historical perspective, an inverted yield\r\ncurve - or a condition when short-term interest rates are higher than\r\nlong-term interest rates- has served as a reliable tool used by economists\r\nto forecast a recession.\r\n\r\nReaders who are unfamiliar with the term \"inverted yield curve\" can access\r\nthe Google.com search engine for an explanation. It's well worth the time.\r\nIn addition, by gaining an understanding of how the yield curve affects\r\nstock prices, an investor can avoid a major downturn in the value of his or\r\nher portfolio.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Weekly Model Portfolio Results\r\n\r\nAs was noted, last week's decline in tech and Internet stocks affected all\r\n15 stocks in the Ones to Watch Model Portfolio - they all finished lower.\r\n\r\nXilinix (XLNX) - 8.1%\r\nBroadcom (BRMC) - 14.2%\r\nCommerce One (CMRC) - 18.8%\r\nNokia (NOK) - 9.1%\r\nCorning Corp.

In the News\r\n\r\nNotice how AOL Time-Warner hardly budged from the previous Friday, while the\r\nother Model Portfolio components declined, on average, roughly 15%.\r\n\r\nSome is written and discussed about AOL Time-Warner everyday in the\r\nfinancial media that keeping up with the developments can amount to a\r\nfull-time job.\r\n\r\n123jump.com writer Janet Evans Arnold provided a recent synopsis concerning\r\nAOL Time-Warner's showdown with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT).\r\n\r\nHere's the report: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11758\r\n\r\nMy take on the situation: Like any big company, AOL Time-Warner plays\r\nhardball with the smaller players in its space, while going head-to-head\r\nwith its peers, such as Microsoft. In order to keep growing at a reasonable\r\nrate at both the top line and bottom line, large companies continually make\r\ndeals with smaller fish as they seek ways to encroach on each other's\r\nestablished turf.\r\n\r\nWhile listening to the post-market commentary on CNBC concerning the\r\nAOL-Microsoft browser squabble, I found one remark interesting: It's not so\r\nmuch a battle for market share as it is more a battle for \"mind share.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the slogan, \"AOL Anywhere\" means exactly that in describing\r\nthe Internet service provider's mission. As for Microsoft, it seems the\r\nworld's largest software company's mission is to have its software products\r\ninstalled in any device run by electricity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sun Microsystems continually pushes its Java programming language\r\nas the standard for communication devices, which, in essence, is a PC's main\r\nfunction now. Hardly a day goes without Sun publishing a press release\r\ntouting its latest deal with a vendor that agrees to implement Java as a\r\nprogramming tool.\r\n\r\nIn some respects, this is a \"tell\" about how hard Sun and other software\r\napplications companies are pushing to remain competitive against Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThe outcome?  Apple Computer (AAPL) is probably the best example of what\r\nwill eventually occur in the programming language/pervasive computing arena.\r\nIn many respects, although Apple makes PCs and laptops, it's a product unto\r\nitself with its own way of doing things that sometimes comes in conflict\r\nwith the rest of the computing world.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the world will have to tolerate several different computing\r\nstandards the same way it has to tolerate the fact that not everyone speaks\r\na universal language. When it comes product preferences, some folks drive\r\nRenaults, others drive Fords and then there's another group that prefers\r\nChevrolets.\r\n\r\nIt will probably always be this way despite attempts by men like Bill Gates\r\nor Scott McNealy or Steve Case to manipulate people into thinking about\r\ncomputers and/or the Internet in only one way - their way.\r\n\r\nAlthough semiconductor companies - both producers and equipment makers -\r\ncontinue to warn that the industry is facing more problems, Xilinix said\r\nthat its financial outlook for the fourth quarter remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nThat's the good news. The bad news is that revenues for the June quarter\r\nwill still show a decline of 15% to 25% sequentially.\r\n\r\nOverall, Xilinx is saying its business is nearing a bottom is what is a\r\nhighly cyclical industry.\r\n\r\nNokia continues to capture market share from its rivals in the cellphone\r\nmarket. According to research firm Gartner Dataquest, Nokia has increased\r\nits world market share to 35.3% from 33.9% in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nNokia is also working behind the scenes to establish a wireless\r\ninfrastructure for 3G mobile phones. But so are its rivals.\r\n\r\nHere again, we have a condition in which a large company does things its\r\nway.\r\n\r\nCheck Point Software, the leader in firewall protection software, took a 10%\r\nhit Monday after some obscure research outfit called Off The Record Research\r\nlast Friday claimed that Check Point was facing a significant sequential\r\nslowing in revenue to price competition from rivals.\r\n\r\nInteresting how a report shows up after the bell on a Friday from an\r\nindependent research firm and gets blown up all out of proportion.\r\n\r\nBut that's the stock market.\r\n\r\nComverse Technology reported first-quarter financial results Monday of 43\r\ncents a share that was a penny better than the Street estimate. The stock\r\ntraded higher in extended hours, but not by an appreciable amount.\r\n\r\nThe Street's reaction was interesting to observe, considering the fact that\r\nComverse Tech, the leader in voice-messaging services, beat the consensus\r\nestimate while setting a new record for year-over-year growth in revenues\r\nand earnings 35% that were in line with its five-year growth rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Technical Analysis\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be considered as a consolation prize in the same way a\r\ncontestant in a beauty contest wins the \"Miss Congeniality\" award, all 15\r\nstocks in the Model Portfolio finished the week ending June 1 above their\r\n52-week lows. Most of the lows occurred between April 3-6 when the Nasdaq\r\nmarketplace hit absolute (we hope) bottom.\r\n\r\nAOL Time-Warner remains above its 200-day moving average, a good technical\r\nsign, but the other components have slipped a little in the past 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Changes to the Model Portfolio\r\n\r\nWhile surfing the Net for financial tid bits, I came across this heading:\r\n\"Oracle goes after Ariba, Commerce One with new software.\"\r\n\r\nI've already dropped B2B software platform provider Ariba (ARBA) from the\r\nModel Portfolio and replaced it with Nokia. Web hosting services firm Exodus\r\nCommunications (EXDS) was dropped in favor or small-cap player Efunds, a\r\nrecent spin-off from Deluxe Corp. (DLX).\r\n\r\nOracle is the world's No. 2 business software maker behind Germany's SAP AG\r\n(SAP). Like any corporate giant, it's under pressure to shore up its top\r\nline and bottom line during tough times. One strategy large companies employ\r\nduring difficult times is to enter new markets, which was meat of the story\r\nconcerning Oracle's thrust into the B2B procurement space supposedly\r\ndominated by Ariba and Commerce One (CMRC).\r\n\r\nThe outcome? In the short-term, it means pricing pressure when a new\r\ncompetitor enters the ring. Ariba and Commerce One are already facing hard\r\ntimes since it's become apparent that large businesses are its chief sources\r\nof revenue. Implementing this software is expensive for middle-sized and\r\nsmall businesses. Procurement can be still be achieved by such arcane\r\ntechnologies as fax machines and telephones.\r\n\r\nSo it's out with Commerce One, the other major B2B player in this space.\r\n\r\nIts replacement, believe it or not, is 1-800-Flowers.com (FLWS), an\r\ne-retailer that sells - you guessed it - floral arrangements over the\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\nThe company is actually a \"multi-channel\" retailer; it provides access for\r\nits flowers and gifts via the Internet, telephone, catalogs and boring\r\nbricks & mortar locations.\r\n\r\n1-800-Flowers.com does have competition from FTD.com (EFTD). In fact, both\r\ncompanies went public at roughly the same time in September 1999. Both are\r\nstill trading below their IPO prices and both stocks have similar charts.\r\n\r\nThere are several positions for switching positions:\r\n\r\n-Low price to sales ratio of 1.45 for the trailing 12 months\r\n-Low debt-to-asset ratio of 0.15\r\n-$84 million in cash\r\n-Rising sales and falling costs\r\n-Rising profit margins\r\n-The company expects EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and\r\namortization), cash flow in other words, to be positive in the current\r\nquarter that ends in July.\r\n\r\nThere are some caveats:\r\n-Flower sales is a seasonal business. The company's best quarter is the\r\nfourth quarter that ends in April and includes Valentine's Day and Easter.\r\n-Company is still burning cash. Profitability is still a conjecture.\r\n-It has competition from FTD.com.\r\n-The slowdown in the U.S. economy, including worker layoffs, could\r\neventually affect retail sales in the second half of 2001.\r\n\r\nMore pluses, however:\r\n\r\n-More participation from institutions (mutual funds, pension funds,\r\ninsurance companies, bank trusts) compared to FTD.com.\r\n-More than just flowers. FLWS sells gifts such as foods and gardening\r\nequipment after a recent acquisition of catalog company Plow and Hearth.\r\n-Despite the fact that insiders own 81% of the outstanding shares, there has\r\nbeen little insider selling in the past 6 months. Means insiders are patient\r\nwith the company.\r\n-Good chart pattern. The 50-day simple moving average line crossed the\r\n200-day moving average line.\r\n-What's interesting to observe is when the moving average lines crossed (a\r\ntechnically bullish indicator) it was in mid-February. The was the exact\r\ntime when the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq 100 Index both went into\r\na precipitous tailspin that eventually exhausted itself on April 3-4.\r\n\r\nA diversified portfolio can be diversified in several ways.  One way is a\r\nconcentration in large-cap stocks that cover several industry groups.\r\nAnother way is to divide the capital into large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap\r\nholdings.\r\n\r\nWall Street at the present time is showing little interest in large-cap\r\nstocks. I've outlined a few of reasons in this newsletter. But all of the\r\nmoney hasn't taken flight to the safety of bonds in the past few months. A\r\nconsiderable portion has drifted toward small-cap stocks.\r\n\r\nLet the trend be your friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.

developments can amount to afull time job 123jump com writer Janet Evans Arnold provided a recent synopsis concerningAOL Time Warner s showdown with Microsoft Corp MSFT Here s the report http www 123jump com story htm story id 11758My take on the situation Like any big company, AOL Time Warner playshardball with the smaller players in its space, while going head to headwith its peers, such as Microsoft In order to keep growing at a reasonablerate at both the top line and bottom line, large companies continually makedeals with smaller fish as they seek ways to encroach on each other sestablished turf While listening to the post market commentary on CNBC concerning theAOL Microsoft browser squabble, I found one remark interesting It s not somuch a battle for market share as it is more a battle for mind share In other words, the slogan, AOL Anywhere means exactly that in describingthe Internet service provider s mission As for Microsoft, it seems theworld s largest software company s mission is to have its software productsinstalled in any device run by electricity Meanwhile, Sun Microsystems continually pushes its Java programming languageas the standard for communication devices, which, in essence, is a PC s mainfunction now Hardly a day goes without Sun publishing a press releasetouting its latest deal with a vendor that agrees to implement Java as aprogramming tool In some respects, this is a tell about how hard Sun and other softwareapplications companies are pushing to remain competitive against Microsoft The outcome Apple Computer AAPL is probably the best example of whatwill eventually occur in the programming language pervasive computing arena In many respects, although Apple makes PCs and laptops, it s a product untoitself with its own way of doing things that sometimes comes in conflictwith the rest of the computing world In other words, the world will have to tolerate several different computingstandards the same way it has to tolerate the fact that not everyone speaksa universal language When it comes product preferences, some folks driveRenaults, others drive Fords and then there s another group that prefersChevrolets It will probably always be this way despite attempts by men like Bill Gatesor Scott McNealy or Steve Case to manipulate people into thinking aboutcomputers and or the Internet in only one way their way Although semiconductor companies both producers and equipment makers continue to warn that the industry is facing more problems, Xilinix saidthat its financial outlook for the fourth quarter remains unchanged That s the good news The bad news is that revenues for the June quarterwill still show a decline of 15 to 25 sequentially Overall, Xilinx is saying its business is nearing a bottom is what is ahighly cyclical industry Nokia continues to capture market share from its rivals in the cellphonemarket According to research firm Gartner Dataquest, Nokia has increasedits world market share to 35 3 from 33 9 in the fourth quarter Nokia is also working behind the scenes to establish a wirelessinfrastructure for 3G mobile phones But so are its rivals Here again, we have a condition in which a large company does things itsway Check Point Software, the leader in firewall protection software, took a 10 hit Monday after some obscure research outfit called Off The Record Researchlast Friday claimed that Check Point was facing a significant sequentialslowing in revenue to price competition from rivals Interesting how a report shows up after the bell on a Friday from anindependent research firm and gets blown up all out of proportion But that s the stock market Comverse Technology reported first quarter financial results Monday of 43cents a share that was a penny better than the Street estimate The stocktraded higher in extended hours, but not by an appreciable amount The Street s reaction was interesting to observe, considering the fact thatComverse Tech, the leader in voice messaging services, beat the consensusestimate while setting a new record for year over year growth in revenuesand earnings 35 that were in line with its five year growth rate 4 Technical AnalysisAlthough it may be considered as a consolation prize in the same way acontestant in a beauty contest wins the Miss Congeniality award, all 15stocks in the Model Portfolio finished the week ending June 1 above their52 week lows Most of the lows occurred between April 3 6 when the Nasdaqmarketplace hit absolute we hope bottom AOL Time Warner remains above its 200 day moving average, a good technicalsign, but the other components have slipped a little in the past 2 weeks 5 Changes to the Model PortfolioWhile surfing the Net for financial tid bits, I came across this heading Oracle goes after Ariba, Commerce One with new software I ve already dropped B2B software platform provider Ariba ARBA from theModel Portfolio and replaced it with Nokia Web hosting services firm ExodusCommunications EXDS was dropped in favor or small cap player Efunds, arecent spin off from Deluxe Corp DLX Oracle is the world s No 2 business software maker behind Germany s SAP AG SAP Like any corporate giant, it s under pressure to shore up its topline and bottom line during tough times One strategy large companies employduring difficult times is to enter new markets, which was meat of the storyconcerning Oracle s thrust into the B2B procurement space supposedlydominated by Ariba and Commerce One CMRC The outcome In the short term, it means pricing pressure when a newcompetitor enters the ring Ariba and Commerce One are already facing hardtimes since it s become apparent that large businesses are its chief sourcesof revenue Implementing this software is expensive for middle sized andsmall businesses Procurement can be still be achieved by such arcanetechnologies as fax machines and telephones So it s out with Commerce One, the other major B2B player in this space Its replacement, believe it or not, is 1 800 Flowers com FLWS , ane retailer that sells you guessed it floral arrangements over theInternet The company is actually a multi channel retailer it provides access forits flowers and gifts via the Internet, telephone, catalogs and boringbricks mortar locations 1 800 Flowers com does have competition from FTD com EFTD In fact, bothcompanies went public at roughly the same time in September 1999 Both arestill trading below their IPO prices and both stocks have similar charts There are several positions for switching positions Low price to sales ratio of 1 45 for the trailing 12 months Low debt to asset ratio of 0 15 84 million in cash Rising sales and falling costs Rising profit margins The company expects EBITDA earnings before interest taxes depreciation andamortization , cash flow in other words, to be positive in the currentquarter that ends in July There are some caveats Flower sales is a seasonal business The company s best quarter is thefourth quarter that ends in April and includes Valentine s Day and Easter Company is still burning cash Profitability is still a conjecture It has competition from FTD com The slowdown in the U S economy, including worker layoffs, couldeventually affect retail sales in the second half of 2001 More pluses, however More participation from institutions mutual funds, pension funds,insurance companies, bank trusts compared to FTD com More than just flowers FLWS sells gifts such as foods and gardeningequipment after a recent acquisition of catalog company Plow and Hearth Despite the fact that insiders own 81 of the outstanding shares, there hasbeen little insider selling in the past 6 months Means insiders are patientwith the company Good chart pattern The 50 day simple moving average line crossed the200 day moving average line What s interesting to observe is when the moving average lines crossed atechnically bullish indicator it was in mid February The was the exacttime when the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq 100 Index both went intoa precipitous tailspin that eventually exhausted itself on April 3 4 A diversified portfolio can be diversified in several ways One way is aconcentration in large cap stocks that cover several industry groups Another way is to divide the capital into large cap, mid cap and small capholdings Wall Street at the present time is showing little interest in large capstocks I ve outlined a few of reasons in this newsletter But all of themoney hasn t taken flight to the safety of bonds in the past few months Aconsiderable portion has

Aptix's products are used to verify system and system-on-chip (SOC) designs and integrate software and third party intellectual property prior to integrated circuit (IC) or board tape-out and fabrication.   \"We selected Aptix because its rapid prototyping platform reduces the product development time of our newest generation of wireless products,\" noted Dr. Stephen Woo, senior director of business and technology at TI's Wireless Center in San Diego, California.   About Aptix Corporation  Aptix Corporation's products are used to verify system and SOC designs prior to IC and board tape-out and fabrication. The Aptix verification methodology allows design blocks to be verified incrementally and in parallel with the design creation process. This shortens prototype development time and provides for early real-world operation of a system prototype.   Aptix is privately held and is headquartered at 2880 North First Street, San Jose, California 95134. Telephone 408/428-6200, Fax 408/944-0646. Visit Aptix on the web at http://www.aptix.com.

The more things change, the more they  \r\nstay the same. There was a big hype in the late 1990's, with the blessing of  \r\nthe Fed, that the economy had entered a new stage of development, supported  \r\nby above average productivity gains driven by technological innovations... \r\nRead the complete article at  \r\nhttp://www.consensus-inc.com/newsletter/feature.htm  \r\n============================================================= \r\nCONSENSUS Index of Bullish Market Opinion \r\nContrary opinion index of market advisors \r\n75% + overbought \r\n25% - oversold \r\nFEATURED MARKET: ORANGE JUICE:   76% \r\nFor more information on all of the CONSENSUS Index of Bullish Market Opinion  \r\npercentages please go to our sample online issue at  \r\nhttp://www.consensus-inc.com/01999si/ Consensus - National Futures and Financial Investment Newspaper  \r\nTo obtain the CONSENSUS Index of Bullish Market Opinion for all 33 markets,  \r\nplease call 900-328-1131 for only $2.99 per minute, updated each Tuesday by  \r\n8:00 PM Central Time.  \r\n============================================================= \r\nTo view TOTAL outline of current issue, visit our website  \r\nhttp://www.consensus-inc.com/  \"Issue Preview\" \r\nPARTIAL OUTLINE OF FEATURED ARTICLES IN CURRENT ISSUE OF CONSENSUS FUTURES  \r\nAND FINANCIAL WEEKLY:  \r\nGANN ANGLES by Phyllis Kahn \r\n(June, 2001) May was a very bullish month for all the stock indices, but the  \r\ndivergence between the individual indices was stronger than ever. The Dow was  \r\nthe undisputed leader except for the NYSE index which managed to make new  \r\nall-time highs. Of course, the NYSE is still trading at the 600+ level,  \r\nhaving missed most of the 18-year surge that took place in the other major  \r\naverages... \r\nEURO/YEN: EURO UNDERVALUED BY 30% LONG-DATED FORWARDS PREDICT FURTHER EURO  \r\nSLIDE by Deutsche Bank AG Foreign Exchange Research Department \r\n(June 1, 2001) The recent decline in the Euro's value has once again pushed  \r\nthe new single European currency into significantly undervalued territory  \r\nversus the U.S. Dollar. According to our purchasing power parity (PPP)  \r\nestimates, the Euro is presently undervalued by nearly 30% versus the dollar.  \r\nHistorically, PPP undervaluations of this magnitude are not often  \r\nsustainable. As Figure 1 shows, when the Euro has moved more than +/-20% out  \r\nof line with its long-run PPP valuation, it has eventually set forces in  \r\nmotion to reverse the currency misalignment... \r\nTHE NEXT GLOBAL GROWTH DERBY HAS BEGUN by Merrill Lynch & Co. Global  \r\nSecurities Research & Economics Group \r\n(May 31, 2001) The stage is set for the next global growth derby. That stage,  \r\nof course, was built on the aggressive reduction in short-term interest rates  \r\naround the globe. All major central banks have recently cut interest rates in  \r\nresponse to the surprisingly rapid deterioration of the global economy since  \r\nthe fourth quarter of last year... \r\nWILD MARKETS AHEAD by Richard A. Brock & Associates, Inc. \r\n(May 25, 2001) Actually, there have been some wild markets behind as well.  \r\nThese have not been easy markets and we don't expect the trends to get any  \r\neasier in the weeks ahead. Current weakness in the grain markets has  \r\ncertainly turned attitudes negative among most producers. But before everyone  \r\nthrows in the towel, remember a couple of things:... \r\nGLOBAL STRATEGY AND INVESTMENT TRENDS by David Fuller \r\n(May 25, 2001) Ronnie Biggs Saga A Metaphor For New Labour--A moment of  \r\nwelcome public relations for the UK's tourism industry, recently trampled by  \r\nfoot-and-mouth disease--Ronnie Biggs of 1960's Great Train Robbery fame gave  \r\nup Brazil's sunshine and Lambada dancers because he missed England's green  \r\nand rolling hills, pubs, national health service and presumably the rain... \r\n============================================================= \r\nThis FREE weekly Newsletter publication is sent ONLY to people who have  \r\nexpressed and interest in financial and investment information. \r\nPlease forward this Newsletter to your Associates/Friends. \r\nSUBSCRIBE mail to:  editior@consensus-inc.com \r\nUNSUBSCRIBE mail to:  editor@consensus-inc.com \r\n============================================================= \r\nThank you for reading the CONSENSUS Market Advisory Newsletter.

GANN ANGLES by Phyllis Kahn June, 2001 May was a very bullish month for all the stock indices, but the divergence between the individual indices was stronger than ever The Dow was the undisputed leader except for the NYSE index which managed to make new all time highs Of course, the NYSE is still trading at the 600 level, having missed most of the 18 year surge that took place in the other major averages EURO YEN EURO UNDERVALUED BY 30 LONG DATED FORWARDS PREDICT FURTHER EURO SLIDE by Deutsche Bank AG Foreign Exchange Research Department June 1, 2001 The recent decline in the Euro s value has once again pushed the new single European currency into significantly undervalued territory versus the U S Dollar According to our purchasing power parity PPP estimates, the Euro is presently undervalued by nearly 30 versus the dollar Historically, PPP undervaluations of this magnitude are not often sustainable As Figure 1 shows, when the Euro has moved more than 20 out of line with its long run PPP valuation, it has eventually set forces in motion to reverse the currency misalignment THE NEXT GLOBAL GROWTH DERBY HAS BEGUN by Merrill Lynch Co Global Securities Research Economics Group May 31, 2001 The stage is set for the next global growth derby That stage, of course, was built on the aggressive reduction in short term interest rates around the globe All major central banks have recently cut interest rates in response to the surprisingly rapid deterioration of the global economy since the fourth quarter of last year WILD MARKETS AHEAD by Richard A Brock

AMCC and Zarlink Semiconductor to Develop Complete 120 Gigabit Short-Reach Optical Solutions\u001dVertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL)-Based Solutions to Quadruple Capacity and Bandwidth Density of Optical Interconnects   SAN DIEGO, Jun 5, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) and Zarlink Semiconductor(TM) (formerly Mitel Semiconductor) today announced they are developing multi-channel, interoperable 10 Gigabit per second (Gbps) per channel products that will offer customers complete short-reach optical connectivity solutions for high-capacity, next-generation networking systems.   Zarlink will introduce 12-channel, VCSEL-based parallel fiber modules operating at 10 Gbps per channel, for an aggregate bandwidth of 120 Gbps. AMCC will bring to market interoperable physical layer, switch fabric, network processing and framer products. The interoperability of AMCC's components and Zarlink's 10 Gbps per channel modules will enable optical systems vendors to quadruple equipment capacity, while reducing development cycles and time to market.   Zarlink expects the market for very short-reach parallel fiber solutions used in and between high-capacity network equipment to grow beyond US $1 billion within three years. The companies' new 10 Gbps parallel fiber products meet customer requirements for lower cost and higher speeds by offering four times the bandwidth density of today's 2.5 Gbps short-reach optical systems.   \"This is the next step in our program to develop a family of very short-reach, high-capacity parallel fiber modules that deliver the industry's best price-performance ratio,\" said Claes Johansson, director of Zarlink's Optical Communications unit. \"Developing modules that transport data at 120 Gbps is made possible by continuing advances in our 10 Gbps VCSEL and patented packaging and manufacturing technologies.\"   Collaborative work on the new 10 Gbps products follows a successful joint program to develop short-reach optical solutions operating at 2.5 Gbps per channel. Zarlink's current generation of 4-, 8- and 12-channel modules utilize AMCC's S7022 Quad VCSEL driver and S7025 Quad transimpedance amplifier (TIA), with integrated limiting amplifier and Loss of Signal (LOS) detection circuitry.   \"We will continue to build on our successful relationship with Zarlink for complete terabit connectivity solutions that complement our PHY, framer/mapper, network processor, and switch fabric products for seamless distributed networking systems,\" said Paul Duran, AMCC's product marketing manager. \"This compelling technology is an essential ingredient in the development of terabit networking systems that require the lowest cost and power dissipation per gigabit as well the highest bandwidth density per square inch.\"   Target applications for the new products include proprietary interconnects in high-capacity scalable multi-chassis routers, switches and optical cross-connects; and standardized interconnects between this type of equipment in central offices. For example, the combination of Zarlink's 10 Gbps per channel parallel fiber modules with AMCC's PHY/framer products will enable a complete and cost-effective 40 Gbps transponder solution for Very Short Reach (VSR) OC-768, compliant with proposed Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) standards.

Enters Into Management Support and\r\nAsset Purchase Agreements With OAN Services Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAvery Communications Inc. (OTCBB:ATEX), a provider of\r\ncustomer care and billing services, announced that, through its\r\nwholly owned subsidiary, ACI Telecommunications Inc. (``ACI''), it\r\nhas entered into a management support and post-petition financing\r\nagreement with OAN Services Inc. (``OAN'') and has reached a\r\ndefinitive agreement to acquire certain assets from OAN for $19.7\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\nLocated in Northridge, Calif., OAN is a competitor of HBS Billing\r\nServices Inc., Avery's local exchange carrier billing clearinghouse\r\noperation in San Antonio. OAN Services filed a petition for\r\nreorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in\r\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Court on May 25, 2001. Both the management\r\nsupport and the asset purchase agreements are subject to\r\nBankruptcy Court approval.\r\n\r\nThe management support agreement with OAN provides for ACI\r\nmanagement to assist OAN in operating its business during the first\r\n90 days of the bankruptcy period. Under this agreement, OAN's\r\ncustomers are assured that there will be no disruption of services\r\nduring the post-petition period and that payments relating to those\r\nservices will be made promptly in the ordinary course of business.\r\n\r\nACI has also agreed to provide debtor in possession financing to\r\nOAN in order to maintain an orderly transition of the business.\r\n\r\nUnder the asset purchase agreement, ACI has agreed to pay\r\napproximately $19.7 million consisting of a combination of assumed\r\nliabilities, debtor in possession financing and cash. OAN assets to be\r\npurchased include customer contracts, local exchange carrier\r\ncontracts for providing billing services, certain hardware and\r\nsoftware technology, and a customer care call center.\r\n\r\n``We are pleased to be able to assist OAN's management and\r\ncustomers during this challenging period,'' commented Patrick J.\r\nHaynes III, chairman of Avery. ``Our focus in this transaction is to\r\nprovide financial stability for OAN's creditors and continuity of\r\nservices for their customers.\r\n\r\n``The potential combination of OAN and HBS will position us as a\r\nmarket leader in the LEC clearinghouse market with an unrivaled\r\ndepth of services and the highest quality of support for our\r\ncustomers. The synergies created by the combination will reduce\r\noverall operating costs and provide additional revenues to meet our\r\ngrowth objectives. This transaction meets our investment criteria for\r\ngrowth opportunities within the LEC billing clearinghouse market.''\r\n\r\n``While we regret having to take this action, we believe it ultimately\r\nwill be in the best interests of all stakeholders,'' said Harvey Berg,\r\npresident of OAN Services.\r\n\r\n``OAN's primary concern remains continuity of service for its\r\ncustomers, and Avery's involvement helps achieve that objective. In\r\naddition, the OAN/Avery combination will be much stronger, with\r\nthe necessary resources that enable it to thrive in a highly\r\ncompetitive environment.''\r\n__________________________________\r\n\r\nAvery Communications Inc. Enters Into Agreement With\r\nQorus.com Inc. to Acquire Aelix Assets\r\n\r\n\r\nAvery Communications Inc. (OTCBB:ATEX), a provider of\r\ncustomer care and billing services, announced it has reached a\r\ndefinitive agreement with Qorus.com Inc. to acquire the messaging\r\nassets of Qorus.com Inc., known as ``Aelix,'' a global notification\r\nand messaging clearinghouse for Customer Relations Management\r\n(CRM) services.\r\n\r\nThe consummation of this transaction will be subject to a number of\r\nconditions, including appropriate regulatory approval, the\r\naffirmative votes of shareholders of the selling company, and receipt\r\nof fairness opinions.\r\n\r\n``The proposed transaction is consistent with Avery's business\r\nexpansion strategy to leverage our expertise of providing billing and\r\ncustomer care solutions to the telecommunications industry to other\r\nindustries and immediately positions us with established global\r\npartners in the travel and hospitality markets. This transaction\r\nsupports management's growth objectives without a significant\r\ndilutive impact on earnings,'' commented Patrick J. Haynes, III,\r\nchairman of Avery Communications.\r\n\r\n``Qorus has begun to pursue other business opportunities to\r\nleverage its expertise in information communications,'' according to\r\nThomas C. Ratchford, Qorus' chief financial officer. The new\r\nbusiness opportunities will likely focus in the business services area.\r\n``We hope to reposition Qorus as a leader in one or more business\r\nservice areas. There have been opportunities to add value to\r\nprofitable cash-flow businesses,'' he said.\r\n\r\n``We are excited about the prospect of becoming a part of Avery\r\nCommunications Inc. This acquisition progresses Aelix from a\r\nventure capital stage company to an operational business subsidiary\r\nof an organization with a much stronger financial base,'' said Aelix\r\nChief Executive Officer Wesley N. Waite, Sr. ``To assure continuity\r\nwithin our industry we will maintain the Aelix corporate identity and\r\ncontinue to offer our OmniReach(SM) product.\r\n\r\n``The additional financial and technical resources available from\r\nAvery should increase our efforts to develop next-generation\r\nplatforms that target enhanced services capabilities and product\r\nofferings.

Globalstar Telecommunications Limited Stock to be Delisted From Nasdaq National Market; Application Submitted for Listing on Nasdaq SmallCap Market   NEW YORK, Jun 5, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Globalstar Telecommunications Limited (NASDAQ:GSTRF) today announced that, on May 31, 2001, it received a Nasdaq Staff Determination indicating that the Company no longer complies with the Minimum Bid Price requirements for continued listing set forth in Market Place Rule 4450(a)(5) and that it is therefore subject to delisting from the Nasdaq National Market.   The Company has applied to transition its listing to the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, and, accordingly, delisting from the Nasdaq National Market has been stayed until a final determination regarding its application is made. There can be no assurance that the Company's application for listing on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market will be approved. If it is not approved, the Company's listing will be transferred to the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board, a regulated quotation service that offers real-time quotes, last-sale prices and volume information on selected over-the-counter equity securities.

We did have Productivity numbers revised down for the first\r\nquarter showing -1.2%, this was the largest change since 93'. On the technical side we had a update on the \"VIX\" index showing  21.22 down -1.61 this was still bearish but showing\r\nsigns of stabilizing. The volume today was much stronger today in the cash market. And the chip sector saw a big boost in the Nasdaq and that helped propel the high tech market. Fed\r\nfutures are now showing a 65% chance of another 1/4% rate cut at the next FOMC meeting and another 24% chance of 1/4% rate cut again in July.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here? The Wave and Fib traders were off on there timing, but they did get to the 1281.00 area today. This was viewed as the top end of the market. Some of them now\r\nare looking at a break above 1283.00 on a closing bases bullish. This \"may\" propel to 1293.00 and then to 1298.00. All I can say is since we are long from 1267.50, GOD I HOPE THERE\r\nRIGHT!!! All this will do is lock in a higher profit on our long. What was very interesting to us today was that we had two trend change signals to go short after we took out 1275.00,\r\nand both were moved to higher levels before being cancelled all together then the system just went flat. However on the last up date at 2:30cst we did get a signal to reverse however\r\nthat was not hit. We \"think\" based on the technical and cash data that the system was calculating the last thirty min of the cash market there is a high probibility that we have hit a\r\ntop and we will be short tomorrow on the open.\r\n\r\nWe do think by no means that going to these higher levels we are on a new bull run. We are and have been for a long time a bear on the long term picture. And its just a matter of time\r\nwe \"think\" will see some ugly moves to the down side. However in the mean time \"In Rome do what the Romans do\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was\r\nintroduced to \"SYSTEM TRADING\" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I\r\nalso feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, (then why would any one\r\nsell it?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.\r\n\r\nI found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a obsevation from them on tracking systems. And I quote \"ALMOST ALL SUCCESSFUL\r\nSYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CONSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote. Well folks\r\nthe fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us and make some $$$\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a example of a client trading two full S/P contracts for the Month of May.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                              DISCRETIONARY     REGULATED-$\r\n\r\n05/02/01 BUY     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1271.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/02/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         6,575.00\r\n05/03/01 BUY     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1262.30\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          30.87\r\n05/03/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1255.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/03/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1259.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/03/01 W/T IN    MGN DEP BY W/T                                           100,000.00\r\n05/03/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         1,700.00\r\n05/03/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         3,875.00\r\n05/04/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1266.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/04/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         3,500.00\r\n05/07/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1265.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/07/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1266.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/07/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                              .00\r\n05/08/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1264.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/08/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                          500.00\r\n05/11/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1248.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/11/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         8,000.00\r\n05/14/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1250.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/14/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                           750.00\r\n05/17/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1292.20\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/17/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       21,100.00\r\n05/21/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1301.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/21/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         4,650.00\r\n05/22/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1310.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/22/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                        4,250.00\r\n05/24/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1289.80\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/24/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       10,100.00\r\n05/25/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1280.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/25/01 GVP FEE   APR CME RB&H G/UP                               3.00\r\n05/25/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         4,650.00\r\n05/31/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1257.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/31/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       11,500.00\r\n* * * * * OPEN POSITIONS * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * OPEN POSITIONS * * * * *\r\n05/31/01    2      JUN 1   IOM S&P INDEX        1257.50           50.00\r\n  IOM        2*     SETTLE    1257.40  OPEN EQUITY                 50.00*\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n         R E F C O,  I N C.

Its been proven that as long\r\nas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human\r\nintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did \"today\" but\r\nwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 \"Single Stock futures\" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r\none of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will\r\nhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r\ncomputer based with there own trading programs.\r\n\r\nAgain for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r\ncontract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.\r\n\r\nCBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited\r\nStake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001\r\n\r\n - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The\r\nChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following\r\napproval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed\r\ninto law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. \"Today's\r\nannouncement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges,\" said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. \"This exciting new\r\ninitiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives\r\ntrading and risk management.\" \"The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r\nsingle-stock futures,\" said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. \"Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r\nexchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products.\" \"I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs\r\nand our members' concerns,\" said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. \"We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r\ngreat benefit to our members.\" \"Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r\nconnectivity of the futures and securities worlds,\" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. \"This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r\nefficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options.\" \"The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new\r\nproduct to our markets,\" said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. \"The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important\r\ncontributions to the success of this venture.\" The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated\r\nexchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r\nsystem. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty\r\nsaid the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate\r\ncontracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r\nselection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r\ncorporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board\r\nOptions Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r\nindexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options\r\nmarketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on\r\nindexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50Ô , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini\r\nS&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.\r\nOn November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by\r\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone who would like to chat in more detail on our CTA managed accts please dont hesitate to call me at toll free (800) 773-1713\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nJerry Jacobs\r\nC.T.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF ANYONE WHO DID NOT GET THE \"PDF\" FILE ATTACHMENT SHOWING THE THREE YEAR\r\nLONG TERM NUMBERS AND FULL CFTC DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT PLEASE E-MAIL\r\nOR CALL TOLL FREE (800) 773-1713 AND WE WILL RESEND IT RIGHT AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\r\n\r\nTHE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN\r\nCONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR\r\nBROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN\r\nFUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU\r\nWILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.\r\n\r\nUNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION.  THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A \"LIMIT MOVE\".  THE PLACEMENT OF\r\nCONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A \"STOP-LOSS\" OR \"STOP-LIMIT\" ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS\r\nMAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.\r\n\r\nA \"SPREAD\" POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE \"LONG\" OR \"SHORT\" POSITION.  THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS\r\nWELL AS FOR YOU.  THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.\r\n\r\nIN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES.  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES\r\nTO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFIT TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.  THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS AT PAGE SEVEN A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED\r\nTO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.\r\n\r\nTHIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY\r\nTRADING BEFORE YOU TRADE, INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT AT PAGE FIVE.\r\n\r\nYOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS.  TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES\r\nINCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION.  FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES\r\nMAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED.  BEFORE YOU TRADE\r\nYOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS\r\nAVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.\r\n\r\nTHIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS.  YOU MUST PLACE ALL FUNDS FOR\r\nTRADING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM DIRECTLY WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal Financial\r\n93 Partridge Dr.\r\nSan Rafael Ca. 94901\r\n800 773-1713   fax 415 457-5088\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***********\r\nEDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

follow through from our forecast of yesterday We were able to see that the Technical chart formations confirmed what the System sawintra day Today In the face of a lot of bearish economic data out, the market pushed forward as a counter trend move We did have Productivity numbers revised down for the firstquarter showing 1 2 , this was the largest change since 93 On the technical side we had a update on the VIX index showing 21 22 down 1 61 this was still bearish but showingsigns of stabilizing The volume today was much stronger today in the cash market And the chip sector saw a big boost in the Nasdaq and that helped propel the high tech market Fedfutures are now showing a 65 chance of another 1 4 rate cut at the next FOMC meeting and another 24 chance of 1 4 rate cut again in July Where do we go from here The Wave and Fib traders were off on there timing, but they did get to the 1281 00 area today This was viewed as the top end of the market Some of them noware looking at a break above 1283 00 on a closing bases bullish This may propel to 1293 00 and then to 1298 00 All I can say is since we are long from 1267 50, GOD I HOPE THERERIGHT All this will do is lock in a higher profit on our long What was very interesting to us today was that we had two trend change signals to go short after we took out 1275 00,and both were moved to higher levels before being cancelled all together then the system just went flat However on the last up date at 2 30cst we did get a signal to reverse howeverthat was not hit We think based on the technical and cash data that the system was calculating the last thirty min of the cash market there is a high probibility that we have hit atop and we will be short tomorrow on the open We do think by no means that going to these higher levels we are on a new bull run We are and have been for a long time a bear on the long term picture And its just a matter of timewe think will see some ugly moves to the down side However in the mean time In Rome do what the Romans do For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I wasintroduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in 1994 00 and have never looked back I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However Ialso feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, then why would any onesell it The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is I found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine,

VALUE 227,571 32 For those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market And bothtechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes havebeen violated regardless of where the futures are What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity s and futures have there own platforms and there own systems Its been proven that as longas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year Humanintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did today butwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame This is the secret for long term success On the E mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8 21 2001 Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will beone of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms willhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12 21 2001 As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are allcomputer based with there own trading programs Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in acontract And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year For more details on this market

potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market And both\r technical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have\r been violated regardless of where the futures are \r What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity s and futures have there own platforms and there own systems Its been proven that as long\r as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year Human\r intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did today but\r whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame This is the secret for long term success \r On the E mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8 21 2001 Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms will\r have access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12 21 2001 As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good \r For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r computer based with there own trading programs \r Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r contract And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year For more details on this market see details below \r CBOE Create Joint Venture on Single Stock Futures World s Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited\r Stake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001\r The world s largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U S are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product single stock futures contracts The\r Chicago Board Options Exchange CBOE and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc CME today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single stock futures, following\r approval by the boards of directors of both exchanges The Chicago Board of Trade CBOT has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake Legislation signed\r into law in December will allow the introduction of single stock futures by U S financial exchanges later this year, after an 18 year prohibition on the products Today s\r announcement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago s exchanges, said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky This exciting new\r initiative combines the best of securities and futures trading Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world s center in derivatives\r trading and risk management The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r single stock futures, said CME Chairman Scott Gordon Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r exchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products I am enthused that Chicago s exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers needs\r and our members concerns, said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r great benefit to our members Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r connectivity of the futures and securities worlds, said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r efficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new\r product to our markets, said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important\r contributions to the success of this venture The joint venture will be a for profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated\r exchange Single stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME s GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r system CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation OCC , which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products McNulty\r said the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC The exchanges anticipate\r contracting with Designated Primary Market Makers DPMs in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r selection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements Single stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r corporate hedging activities CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange for physicals EFPs The Chicago Board\r Options Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982 Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r indexes, such as the S P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq 100, and the S P 100 It remains the world s largest and most successful options\r marketplace Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S P 500 in 1982 Today, CME trades futures and futures options on\r indexes including the S P 500, Nasdaq 100, S P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e 50Ô , S P BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E mini\r S P 500 and E mini Nasdaq 100 contracts the fastest growing products in the exchange s history CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products \r On November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for profit, shareholder owned corporation CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC CME is regulated by\r the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites www cboe com and www cme com \r If anyone who would like to chat in more detail on our CTA managed accts please dont hesitate to call me at

This positive news sent the Nasdaq sharply\r\nhigher on the day filling last Wednesday's gap at 2170.58 thereby\r\nincreasing the odds that a short-term bottom was likely posted with\r\nlast week's low. Today's strong gains turned momentum indicators\r\nneutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during\r\nthe first half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe Dow also closed higher on Tuesday due to spillover support from\r\nthe Nasdaq and S&P 500 index. The Dow's solid rebound off last\r\nFriday's low has turned short-term momentum indicators neutral to\r\nbullish signaling that additional gains are possible. However, I\r\nwould not be surprised to see a pause if not modest setback on\r\nWednesday as the Dow may consolidate some of its recent gains before\r\nextending its rebound off last week's low. Closes above May's high\r\ncrossing at 1135 are needed to renew this spring's rally.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES September bonds closed higher for the fifth day in a\r\nrow following the release of the National Association of Purchasing\r\nManagement's May non-manufacturing index showed continued weakness\r\nand the April factory orders report was softer than expected.\r\nSeptember bonds have retraced just over 62% of May's decline. If the\r\nrally continues, the 75% retracement level crossing at 101-20, then\r\nMay's high at 102-22 are potential targets later this month. Momentum\r\nindicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices into\r\nearly-June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe CRB INDEX closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as\r\nit continues to consolidate above trading range support crossing at\r\n208.43. Closes below this support level would confirm a trading range\r\nbreakout thereby opening the door for a larger-degree decline during\r\nJune. At the same time, momentum indicators are becoming oversold\r\nwarning traders that the CRB might have posted a broad double bottom\r\nwith last week's low. Closes above broken support crossing at 213.20\r\nare needed to temper the bearish outlook.\r\n\r\nENERGY MARKETS were mixed on Tuesday. Early strength in the energy\r\nproducts was due to short covering, which was triggered by a refinery\r\nsnag. However, weakness in the cash markets tempered today's gains as\r\ntraders await this afternoon's API inventory data reports. In other\r\nnews, OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna are likely to keep production\r\nquotas and current levels. They also are likely to increase\r\nproduction to offset the short fall caused by Iraq's suspension of\r\noil exports over the weekend.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil closed higher on Tuesday as it continues to\r\nconsolidate above the 50% retracement level of the December/May rally\r\ncrossing at 27.51. Momentum indicators are bearish but nearing their\r\nrespective oversold zones warning bears to use caution when trying to\r\npress their hand. If the decline off May's high resumes, April's\r\nreaction low crossing at 27.25 is July's next target.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil closed higher on Tuesday due to short covering\r\nthereby leaving Monday's downside reversal unconfirmed. Closes below\r\nlast week's low, which coincides with the 38% retracement level of\r\nthe December/May rally crossing at 75.66 are needed to renew July's\r\ndecline off May's high. Stochastics and RSI remain bearish signaling\r\nthat additional weakness near-term is possible.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas spiked below last week's low crossing at 90.30 and\r\nthis year's uptrend line before a short covering bounce tempered some\r\nof today's losses. A number of short- term momentum indicators though\r\nbearish are becoming oversold hinting that we could see a short\r\ncovering bounce off the aforementioned uptrend line. If this support\r\nlevel is broken, the door would be open for a possible test of\r\nApril's gap crossing at 87.25 later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas posted a huge key reversal down on Tuesday\r\nafter early session strength failed to attract follow-through buying.\r\nAdditional weakness on Wednesday is needed to confirm today's bearish\r\nreversal pattern thereby signaling the likely end of the corrective\r\nrebound off last week's low.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES The September Dollar closed lower on Tuesday due to light\r\nprofit taking amidst rumors of European Central Bank intervention.\r\nAdditional weakness on Wednesday is needed to confirm today's bearish\r\nreversal pattern however, it will take closes below May's uptrend\r\nline crossing near 118.57 to signal that a short-term bottom has\r\nlikely been posted. Until then the door remains open for sideways to\r\nhigher prices during the first half of June. The daily ADX (a\r\ntrend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that additional\r\nstrength is possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc closed sharply higher on Tuesday and in\r\ndoing so filled last week's gap at .5631. Closes above .5645 are\r\nneeded to turn a number of momentum indicators neutral to bullish\r\nthereby increasing the odds that a short-term bottom might be in\r\nplace. Until then, the door remains open for a test of weekly support\r\ncrossing at .5508.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar posted a potential key reversal up on\r\nTuesday and is set to challenge trading range resistance crossing at\r\n.6541. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to\r\nconfirm a breakout and renew the rally off April's low. Momentum\r\nindicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices\r\nduring the first half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen posted a key reversal down on Tuesday and\r\nin doing so turned a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral\r\nto bearish. Additional weakness on Wednesday is needed to confirm\r\ntoday's bearish reversal pattern. However, the close below trading\r\nrange resistance crossing at .8425 is a clear warning to bulls that a\r\ntop and trend change might be near.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS August gold closed slightly higher on Tuesday as it\r\ncontinues to consolidate around the 75% retracement level of this\r\nspring's rally crossing at 267.20. While the near-term trend is down,\r\nthe recent consolidation near the aforementioned support level along\r\nwith stochastics and RSI becoming oversold hint that a short-term\r\nbottom might be in or near. If the decline continues, the reaction\r\nlow crossing at 263.20 is August's next target.\r\n\r\nJuly silver posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close to\r\nconsolidate some of Monday's losses. The door remains open for a test\r\nof trading range support crossing at 4.31 cents. If this support\r\nlevel is broken, the door would be open for additional weakness and a\r\npossible test of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly copper closed higher on Tuesday due to short covering following\r\nMonday's spike below May's low at 74.75. Momentum indicators remain\r\nbearish hinting that additional weakness is possible. Closes below\r\nMonday's low would open the door for a test of weekly support\r\ncrossing at 74.10 later this month. Closes above 77.20 would increase\r\nthe odds that a double bottom was posted with Monday's low.\r\n\r\nGRAINS July corn posted a downside reversal with a lower close as\r\nbuying faded into the close. Talk of warmer weather by the weekend or\r\nearly next week erased early support due to Monday's bullish crop\r\nconditions report. Even if the weather forecast are true, this week's\r\ncool/wet weather will likely cause further deterioration in next\r\nMonday's crop ratings report. Despite today's sell off, the recent\r\ntrendline breakout has opened the door for sideways to higher prices\r\nwith May's high at 2.11 1/2 being a possible target.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat extended Monday's decline despite Monday's friendly crop\r\ncondition report that showed further deterioration in the winter\r\nwheat crop. Harvest pressure along with a favorable world weather\r\noutlook for wheat- producing areas and stagnant U.S. export demand\r\ncontinues to weigh on prices. While a short covering bounce is\r\npossible on Wednesday as July may try and consolidate some of this\r\nweek's losses, momentum indicators have turned bearish and the door\r\nis open for sideways to lower prices into mid-June.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed fractionally higher on Tuesday.\r\nEarly strength was tied to Monday's friendly crop condition report.\r\nHowever, extended forecasts are calling for a warm up and drier\r\nconditions to move into the Midwest by the weekend or early next\r\nweek, which sent buyers to the sidelines. Traders remain reluctant to\r\npush the panic button despite slow crop development and declining\r\ncrop conditions given the projected increase in next year's carryout\r\nand the strong U.S. Dollar. Look for two-sided trading to continue\r\nnear-term.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal gapped up and closed higher on Tuesday but near\r\nsession lows due to profit taking ahead of the close. Early support\r\nwas due to Monday's crop conditions reports and spillover short\r\ncovering following Monday's upside reversal. July meal needs to close\r\nabove 168 or below 159.60 to clear up near-term direction in the\r\nmarket. Until then, look for two-sided trading to continue to\r\ndominate the market.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK August hogs closed lower on Tuesday on ideas that meat\r\npackers will reduce slaughter thereby pressuring the cash market.\r\nAdditional pressure came from ideas that August has become slightly\r\noverbought technically. However, today's mid-range close leaves the\r\ndoor open for sideways trading on Wednesday. If the rally resumes,\r\nApril's high crossing at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below\r\nlast week's gap at 64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top\r\nhas been posted.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed slightly lower on Tuesday as traders await\r\ndirection from the cash market. The recent rally in futures appears\r\nto have priced in $76 cash bids. Momentum indicators have become very\r\noverbought warning bulls to use caution a the market might be forming\r\na broad double top with January's high.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Tuesday thereby confirming\r\nMonday's key reversal up. Today's rally also turned a number of\r\noversold momentum indicators neutral to bullish thereby increasing\r\nthe odds that last week's low might have marked a short-term bottom.\r\nCloses above May's downtrend line crossing near 62.10 are needed\r\nbefore this is confirmed.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed higher on Tuesday due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's upside reversal. Nevertheless, July remains below\r\nbroken trading range support crossing at 955. Multiple closes above\r\nthis broken support level are needed to temper the near-term bearish\r\noutlook in the market. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming\r\noversold warning bears to use caution when pressing the short side of\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as it\r\ncontinues to consolidate above last week's apparent double bottom.\r\nMomentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that\r\nadditional short covering off last week's low is possible. If the\r\ndecline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on\r\nTuesday. Additional weakness would increase the odds that the short\r\ncovering bounce off last week's low may have run its course. It will\r\ntake closes above this year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95 to\r\nconfirm that a bottom and trend change has taken place.

This positive news sent the Nasdaq sharply\r\nhigher on the day filling last Wednesday's gap at 2170.58 thereby\r\nincreasing the odds that a short-term bottom was likely posted with\r\nlast week's low. Today's strong gains turned momentum indicators\r\nneutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during\r\nthe first half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe Dow also closed higher on Tuesday due to spillover support from\r\nthe Nasdaq and S&P 500 index. The Dow's solid rebound off last\r\nFriday's low has turned short-term momentum indicators neutral to\r\nbullish signaling that additional gains are possible. However, I\r\nwould not be surprised to see a pause if not modest setback on\r\nWednesday as the Dow may consolidate some of its recent gains before\r\nextending its rebound off last week's low. Closes above May's high\r\ncrossing at 1135 are needed to renew this spring's rally.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES September bonds closed higher for the fifth day in a\r\nrow following the release of the National Association of Purchasing\r\nManagement's May non-manufacturing index showed continued weakness\r\nand the April factory orders report was softer than expected.\r\nSeptember bonds have retraced just over 62% of May's decline. If the\r\nrally continues, the 75% retracement level crossing at 101-20, then\r\nMay's high at 102-22 are potential targets later this month. Momentum\r\nindicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices into\r\nearly-June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe CRB INDEX closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as\r\nit continues to consolidate above trading range support crossing at\r\n208.43. Closes below this support level would confirm a trading range\r\nbreakout thereby opening the door for a larger-degree decline during\r\nJune. At the same time, momentum indicators are becoming oversold\r\nwarning traders that the CRB might have posted a broad double bottom\r\nwith last week's low. Closes above broken support crossing at 213.20\r\nare needed to temper the bearish outlook.\r\n\r\nENERGY MARKETS were mixed on Tuesday. Early strength in the energy\r\nproducts was due to short covering, which was triggered by a refinery\r\nsnag. However, weakness in the cash markets tempered today's gains as\r\ntraders await this afternoon's API inventory data reports. In other\r\nnews, OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna are likely to keep production\r\nquotas and current levels. They also are likely to increase\r\nproduction to offset the short fall caused by Iraq's suspension of\r\noil exports over the weekend.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil closed higher on Tuesday as it continues to\r\nconsolidate above the 50% retracement level of the December/May rally\r\ncrossing at 27.51. Momentum indicators are bearish but nearing their\r\nrespective oversold zones warning bears to use caution when trying to\r\npress their hand. If the decline off May's high resumes, April's\r\nreaction low crossing at 27.25 is July's next target.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil closed higher on Tuesday due to short covering\r\nthereby leaving Monday's downside reversal unconfirmed. Closes below\r\nlast week's low, which coincides with the 38% retracement level of\r\nthe December/May rally crossing at 75.66 are needed to renew July's\r\ndecline off May's high. Stochastics and RSI remain bearish signaling\r\nthat additional weakness near-term is possible.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas spiked below last week's low crossing at 90.30 and\r\nthis year's uptrend line before a short covering bounce tempered some\r\nof today's losses. A number of short- term momentum indicators though\r\nbearish are becoming oversold hinting that we could see a short\r\ncovering bounce off the aforementioned uptrend line. If this support\r\nlevel is broken, the door would be open for a possible test of\r\nApril's gap crossing at 87.25 later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas posted a huge key reversal down on Tuesday\r\nafter early session strength failed to attract follow-through buying.\r\nAdditional weakness on Wednesday is needed to confirm today's bearish\r\nreversal pattern thereby signaling the likely end of the corrective\r\nrebound off last week's low.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES The September Dollar closed lower on Tuesday due to light\r\nprofit taking amidst rumors of European Central Bank intervention.\r\nAdditional weakness on Wednesday is needed to confirm today's bearish\r\nreversal pattern however, it will take closes below May's uptrend\r\nline crossing near 118.57 to signal that a short-term bottom has\r\nlikely been posted. Until then the door remains open for sideways to\r\nhigher prices during the first half of June. The daily ADX (a\r\ntrend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that additional\r\nstrength is possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc closed sharply higher on Tuesday and in\r\ndoing so filled last week's gap at .5631. Closes above .5645 are\r\nneeded to turn a number of momentum indicators neutral to bullish\r\nthereby increasing the odds that a short-term bottom might be in\r\nplace. Until then, the door remains open for a test of weekly support\r\ncrossing at .5508.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar posted a potential key reversal up on\r\nTuesday and is set to challenge trading range resistance crossing at\r\n.6541. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to\r\nconfirm a breakout and renew the rally off April's low. Momentum\r\nindicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices\r\nduring the first half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen posted a key reversal down on Tuesday and\r\nin doing so turned a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral\r\nto bearish. Additional weakness on Wednesday is needed to confirm\r\ntoday's bearish reversal pattern. However, the close below trading\r\nrange resistance crossing at .8425 is a clear warning to bulls that a\r\ntop and trend change might be near.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS August gold closed slightly higher on Tuesday as it\r\ncontinues to consolidate around the 75% retracement level of this\r\nspring's rally crossing at 267.20. While the near-term trend is down,\r\nthe recent consolidation near the aforementioned support level along\r\nwith stochastics and RSI becoming oversold hint that a short-term\r\nbottom might be in or near. If the decline continues, the reaction\r\nlow crossing at 263.20 is August's next target.\r\n\r\nJuly silver posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close to\r\nconsolidate some of Monday's losses. The door remains open for a test\r\nof trading range support crossing at 4.31 cents. If this support\r\nlevel is broken, the door would be open for additional weakness and a\r\npossible test of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly copper closed higher on Tuesday due to short covering following\r\nMonday's spike below May's low at 74.75. Momentum indicators remain\r\nbearish hinting that additional weakness is possible. Closes below\r\nMonday's low would open the door for a test of weekly support\r\ncrossing at 74.10 later this month. Closes above 77.20 would increase\r\nthe odds that a double bottom was posted with Monday's low.\r\n\r\nGRAINS July corn posted a downside reversal with a lower close as\r\nbuying faded into the close. Talk of warmer weather by the weekend or\r\nearly next week erased early support due to Monday's bullish crop\r\nconditions report. Even if the weather forecast are true, this week's\r\ncool/wet weather will likely cause further deterioration in next\r\nMonday's crop ratings report. Despite today's sell off, the recent\r\ntrendline breakout has opened the door for sideways to higher prices\r\nwith May's high at 2.11 1/2 being a possible target.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat extended Monday's decline despite Monday's friendly crop\r\ncondition report that showed further deterioration in the winter\r\nwheat crop. Harvest pressure along with a favorable world weather\r\noutlook for wheat- producing areas and stagnant U.S. export demand\r\ncontinues to weigh on prices. While a short covering bounce is\r\npossible on Wednesday as July may try and consolidate some of this\r\nweek's losses, momentum indicators have turned bearish and the door\r\nis open for sideways to lower prices into mid-June.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed fractionally higher on Tuesday.\r\nEarly strength was tied to Monday's friendly crop condition report.\r\nHowever, extended forecasts are calling for a warm up and drier\r\nconditions to move into the Midwest by the weekend or early next\r\nweek, which sent buyers to the sidelines. Traders remain reluctant to\r\npush the panic button despite slow crop development and declining\r\ncrop conditions given the projected increase in next year's carryout\r\nand the strong U.S. Dollar. Look for two-sided trading to continue\r\nnear-term.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal gapped up and closed higher on Tuesday but near\r\nsession lows due to profit taking ahead of the close. Early support\r\nwas due to Monday's crop conditions reports and spillover short\r\ncovering following Monday's upside reversal. July meal needs to close\r\nabove 168 or below 159.60 to clear up near-term direction in the\r\nmarket. Until then, look for two-sided trading to continue to\r\ndominate the market.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK August hogs closed lower on Tuesday on ideas that meat\r\npackers will reduce slaughter thereby pressuring the cash market.\r\nAdditional pressure came from ideas that August has become slightly\r\noverbought technically. However, today's mid-range close leaves the\r\ndoor open for sideways trading on Wednesday. If the rally resumes,\r\nApril's high crossing at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below\r\nlast week's gap at 64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top\r\nhas been posted.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed slightly lower on Tuesday as traders await\r\ndirection from the cash market. The recent rally in futures appears\r\nto have priced in $76 cash bids. Momentum indicators have become very\r\noverbought warning bulls to use caution a the market might be forming\r\na broad double top with January's high.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Tuesday thereby confirming\r\nMonday's key reversal up. Today's rally also turned a number of\r\noversold momentum indicators neutral to bullish thereby increasing\r\nthe odds that last week's low might have marked a short-term bottom.\r\nCloses above May's downtrend line crossing near 62.10 are needed\r\nbefore this is confirmed.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed higher on Tuesday due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's upside reversal. Nevertheless, July remains below\r\nbroken trading range support crossing at 955. Multiple closes above\r\nthis broken support level are needed to temper the near-term bearish\r\noutlook in the market. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming\r\noversold warning bears to use caution when pressing the short side of\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as it\r\ncontinues to consolidate above last week's apparent double bottom.\r\nMomentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that\r\nadditional short covering off last week's low is possible. If the\r\ndecline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on\r\nTuesday. Additional weakness would increase the odds that the short\r\ncovering bounce off last week's low may have run its course.

copper closed higher on Tuesday due to short covering following\r Monday s spike below May s low at 74 75 Momentum indicators remain\r bearish hinting that additional weakness is possible Closes below\r Monday s low would open the door for a test of weekly support\r crossing at 74 10 later this month Closes above 77 20 would increase\r the odds that a double bottom was posted with Monday s low \r GRAINS July corn posted a downside reversal with a lower close as\r buying faded into the close Talk of warmer weather by the weekend or\r early next week erased early support due to Monday s bullish crop\r conditions report Even if the weather forecast are true, this week s\r cool wet weather will likely cause further deterioration in next\r Monday s crop ratings report Despite today s sell off, the recent\r trendline breakout has opened the door for sideways to higher prices\r with May s high at 2 11 1 2 being a possible target \r July wheat extended Monday s decline despite Monday s friendly crop\r condition report that showed further deterioration in the winter\r wheat crop Harvest pressure along with a favorable world weather\r outlook for wheat producing areas and stagnant U S export demand\r continues to weigh on prices While a short covering bounce is\r possible on Wednesday as July may try and consolidate some of this\r week s losses, momentum indicators have turned bearish and the door\r is open for sideways to lower prices into mid June \r SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed fractionally higher on Tuesday \r Early strength was tied to Monday s friendly crop condition report \r However, extended forecasts are calling for a warm up and drier\r conditions to move into the Midwest by the weekend or early next\r week, which sent buyers to the sidelines Traders remain reluctant to\r push the panic button despite slow crop development and declining\r crop conditions given the projected increase in next year s carryout\r and the strong U S Dollar Look for two sided trading to continue\r near term \r July soybean meal gapped up and closed higher on Tuesday but near\r session lows due to profit taking ahead of the close Early support\r was due to Monday s crop conditions reports and spillover short\r covering following Monday s upside reversal July meal needs to close\r above 168 or below 159 60 to clear up near term direction in the\r market Until then, look for two sided trading to continue to\r dominate the market \r LIVESTOCK August hogs closed lower on Tuesday on ideas that meat\r packers will reduce slaughter thereby pressuring the cash market \r Additional pressure came from ideas that August has become slightly\r overbought technically However, today s mid range close leaves the\r door open for sideways trading on Wednesday If the rally resumes,\r April s high crossing at 65 95 is August s next target Closes below\r last week s gap at 64 00 would strongly suggest that a short term top\r has been posted \r August cattle closed slightly lower on Tuesday as traders await\r direction from the cash market The recent rally in futures appears\r to have priced in 76 cash bids Momentum indicators have become very\r overbought warning bulls to use caution a the market might be forming\r a broad double top with January s high \r FOOD FIBER July coffee closed higher on Tuesday thereby confirming\r Monday s key reversal up Today s rally also turned a number of\r oversold momentum indicators neutral to bullish thereby increasing\r the odds that last week s low might have marked a short term bottom \r Closes above May s downtrend line crossing near 62 10 are needed\r before this is confirmed \r July cocoa closed higher on Tuesday due to light short covering\r following Monday s upside reversal Nevertheless, July remains below\r broken trading range support crossing at 955 Multiple closes above\r this broken support level are needed to temper the near term bearish\r outlook in the market Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming\r oversold warning bears to use caution when pressing the short side of\r the market \r July sugar closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as it\r continues to consolidate above last week s apparent double bottom \r Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that\r additional short covering off last week s low is possible If the\r decline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets \r July cotton posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on\r Tuesday Additional weakness would increase the odds that the short\r covering bounce off last week s low may have run its course It will\r take closes above this year s downtrend line crossing near 43 95 to\r confirm that a bottom and trend change has taken place Until then,\r the overall downtrend remains intact \r Daily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\r INO com s end of day charting software for Futures, Futures\r Options and

The S&P 500 climbed 16 to 1283, and the Dow rose 114 to\r\n11,175. Volume surged to 1.31 billion shares on the NYSE, and 1.82 billion\r\non the Nasdaq. Advancers led 19 to 10 on the NYSE, and 24 to 13 on the\r\nNasdaq. For earnings reports, visit our earnings calendar at\r\nhttp://www.wsrn.com/apps/earnings/internet.xpl and reported earnings at\r\nhttp://www.wsrn.com/apps/earnings/ireported.xpl. For after hours quotes\r\nand news, visit our after hours trading site at\r\nhttp://www.afterhourstrading.com.\r\n\r\nComverse (NASDAQ:CMVT) soared 9.02 to 67.68 after beating estimates by a\r\npenny with 43-cent earnings, and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) rose 4.02 to 45.61\r\nafter reaffirming estimates. Even beleaguered Lucent (NYSE:LU) got in on\r\nthe act, rising .49 to 8.49 after reaffirming its quarter.\r\n\r\nCiena (NASDAQ:CIEN), which presents at the SuperComm conference tomorrow\r\nmorning, rose 4.97 to 59.70 on bullish comments from Goldman Sachs. Cisco\r\n(NASDAQ:CSCO), up 1.81 to 21.54, rose on comments from SuperComm that its\r\nCerent product orders may be picking up.\r\n\r\nRealNetworks (NASDAQ:RNWK) gave back strong gains to close up .11 to 12.55\r\nafter Dow Jones reported that AOL (NYSE:AOL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\r\ntalks may resume.\r\n\r\nUlticom (NASDAQ:ULCM) bolted 3.95 to 30.14 on an expanded relationship\r\nwith IBM.\r\n\r\nCheck Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) continued to slump on business concerns, off\r\n1.36 to 47.93. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) slipped .41 to 16.50 despite\r\nassertions that it expects to turn profitable in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nNokia (NYSE:NOK) climbed 1.65 to 30.93 on positive analyst comments.\r\n\r\nSome technical comments on the market: Note: We include charts in the\r\ntechnical market commentary. If you can't get the charts via the e-mail\r\nnewsletter version, try this link:\r\nhttp://www.afterhourstrading.com/column.html\r\n\r\nA nice day today, and on rising, albeit average, volume to boot. That\r\nshould take away some of the near-term risk that this low-volume rally\r\npresented, but we are still in a cycle turn window for the next day or\r\ntwo. 1200 on the S&P 500 and 2000 on the Nasdaq remain our lines in the\r\nsand; above those levels, the market looks okay, and below those levels, a\r\nretest of the lows becomes likely. The Dow (first chart) is now clearly\r\nabove both 11,000 resistance and its main downtrend line, but needs to\r\ntake out 11,400. Critical support on the index 11,000 and then 10,750, a\r\ntrendline off the March lows. The S&P 500 (second chart) cleared the\r\nimportant 1265 level, the neckline of a potential inverted\r\nhead-and-shoulders bottom, and its September downtrend line, both good\r\nsigns. The 1265-1275 level should now be support. The Nasdaq (third chart)\r\nis just below critical 2252 resistance, and could be forming a rising\r\nwedge (fourth chart). That rising wedge is something to keep an eye on,\r\nsince we now have a firm lower trendline on the index for the first time.\r\nThe semiconductor stocks were strong today, a good sign for further\r\nshort-term follow-through to the upside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial report: For a free introduction to technical chart patterns and an\r\noverview of last year's action in the stock market, visit\r\nhttp://www.internetstockreport.com/guest/article/0,1785,2571_500051,00.html.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Neither internet.com nor the writers of this newsletter makes\r\nspecific trading recommendations or gives individualized market advice.\r\nInformation contained in this newsletter is provided as an information\r\nservice only.  internet.com recommends that you get personal advice from\r\nan investment professional before buying or selling stocks or other\r\nsecurities.

{"raw": "Subject: How the 3-Year-Old \"Hidden Bear Market\" Can Make You Rich Over the Next 10 Years\r\nFrom: \"Daily Reckoning and StockScape StkScape@agoramail.net@ENRON\" <imceanotes-daily+20reckoning+20and+20stockscape+20+3cstkscape+40agoramail+2enet+3e+40enron@enron.com>\r\nDate: Wed, 06 Jun 2001 02:09:27 +0200\r\nTo: alewis@ect.enron.com\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Daily Reckoning Reader,\r\n\r\nBad news dominates the financial headlines lately: The economy\r\nis slowing. Mutual fund inflows have fallen by half. Consumer\r\nconfidence is at a 7-year low. Earnings warnings are up 96% from\r\na year ago. The Nasdaq is down almost 60% and refuses to revive\r\ndespite rate cuts...\r\n\r\nBut that's exactly why Bill asked me to write to you today. You\r\nsee,  I'd like to show you a few companies that go against the\r\ngrain...and are poised to give great returns...\r\n\r\nWhat's more, I'd like to introduce you to an extraordinary new\r\nway to make money off the success these companies are going to\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month when Bill was in Baltimore, I mentioned a few\r\ntemporarily market-forgotten old economy companies that are so\r\ncheap now, they're going to explode even if Wall Street never\r\ngives them the red-carpet push it gave the dot-coms. It's all\r\nthere in the bottom line... And he said: \"Lynn, I think you're\r\non to something... You have to write it up for the Daily\r\nReckoning readers.\" So... Here it is.\r\n\r\nWhen you follow the link included below you'll find a unique way\r\nto make money from the following companies:\r\n\r\n-- A defense company ready to cash in on the Bush-Cheney\r\nadministration. Even if this company maintains its growth rate\r\nof the previous three years, it's poised to be a knockout\r\n20-bagger in 10 years. In fact, by my calculations... its\r\n\"intrinsic\" value discounted for the risk-free rate of the\r\n3-year Treasury bond is a whopping $2,032. That makes the $90\r\nprice tag today a mere pittance... and a \"sure thing\" for our\r\n10-year plan.\r\n\r\n-- Give it any good news at all, and this second company will\r\nlikely double in a year. And right now... it's selling for only\r\nhalf its annual sales. The company misstepped under a shiftless\r\nCEO, and Wall Street drove the price down to bargain-basement\r\nprices. But now the man who led the company to strength in the\r\npast is back at the helm. It should grow 13% a year when it gets\r\nback on track, but even if it only matches the S&P's lower 11.8%\r\naverage, it's still worth $114.26. And that makes today's price\r\nof $32.85 a big, fat 70% off sign in our book.\r\n\r\n-- Celebrate bad news by buying a winning retailer just when\r\neveryone says it's the wrong thing to do. That's how buying low\r\nand selling high is done. This company owns two off -- price\r\nretail giants. Both have a track record of outperforming their\r\npeers over the long run in any kind of environment. And now it's\r\ngoing for $33 - about a third of what we estimate to be the true\r\nvalue - $101.45. And that's conservative...\r\n\r\nThe Key to Long-term Investment Success: Big Profits, Small Risk\r\nAnd Consistency, Consistency, Consistency...\r\n\r\nBut there's more. When you read the enclosed report, you'll\r\nlearn that whenever we make an investment recommendation in The\r\nFleet Street Letter, profit potential is important -- but it's\r\nnot enough. The Nasdaq is littered with stocks that are down 90%\r\nthat major Wall Street firms said had great \"profit potential\"\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nInstead, we look for a proven track record, a realistic\r\npotential for above-average long-term gains, and a level of risk\r\nthat is far below our potential gains. That is key. That's the\r\nway we've done it since we published our very first privately-\r\ncirculated investment advisory back in 1938.\r\n\r\nFor a select group of investors, the profits to be made over the\r\nnext 10 years will be greater than the last 10... In fact, I\r\nbelieve you could increase the value of your portfolio ten-fold\r\nor more over the next 10 years!

Searching For MACD Breakouts\r\n2.  Search Criteria\r\n3.  One Stock With A Recent Positive MACD Breakout\r\n4.  Disclaimer\r\n\r\n***********************Our Sponsor*************************\r\nSTRAIGHT TALK FOR TOUGH TIMES\r\nINDIVIDUAL INVESTOR Magazine puts the market in perspective...\r\nwhat stocks are coming back, when to cut your losses, where to\r\nfind value.

Searching For MACD Breakouts\r\n\r\nThe Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) is one of\r\nthe most used technical indicators.  It is an oscillator\r\nuses the difference between two moving averages, for purposes\r\nof the search - the 12 and 25 day moving averages, to\r\ncalculate a 9-day moving average.  The resulting 9-day\r\nmoving average is then smoothed to form a signal line.  A\r\npositive breakout, which signals a buying opportunity,\r\noccurs when the MACD crosses above the signal line.\r\n\r\nMACD Breakouts is a search strategy that screens for stocks\r\nwhich have had a positive MACD breakout within the past two\r\ndays.  Two criteria, 30-day Average Volume and Stock Exchange,\r\nare included in the restrictive mode to ensure that the\r\nstocks found by the search strategy have at least minimal\r\nlevels of liquidity.  Illiquid stocks may be prone to more\r\nvolatile moves, reducing the accuracy of oscillators in\r\npredicting trends.\r\n\r\nReturn on Equity (ROE) is included a final criteria, in the\r\nrank mode.  Backtested results showed improved performance\r\nwhen this indicator was included compared to excluding any\r\nfundamental criteria.  The reason for the improved\r\nperformance is that stocks with strong underlying\r\nfundamentals are better positioned to sustain long-term\r\nupward moves than those that are fundamentally weak.\r\n\r\nThe search strategy can be run on a daily basis and is useful\r\nfor both active traders and long-term investors who are\r\nlooking for potential buy signals.  It should be noted that\r\nmany technicians rely on a combination of several buy signals\r\nand a positive MACD breakout should be used as an indication\r\nto conduct further analysis, rather than as a sole indication\r\nto enter into a position.

Investors who took the risk of buying last July\r\nhave been rewarded with a 85 percent gain.

A typical day will\r\nyield several comments about our services. All in all, it is\r\ntypically the best part of my day.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I get a comment that also offers personal\r\nobservations. These are often loaded with\r\nwisdom directly from a trader. CTS Hot Today is\r\nmeant to convey a little wisdom every day, and\r\nit doesn't always have to be my own. Yesterday, a good\r\ncustomer of CTS wrote an excellent testimonial about his\r\nexperience and then elaborated on his approach with an\r\nanalogy to the great game of football. We asked and he\r\nagreed to let us publish his comments, and I hope you\r\nwill enjoy reading a fellow traders wisdom in today's\r\nspecial edition...\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrom David Breen Jr. (CTS customer since 1997)\r\nIn this business it's rare to find someone selling subscriptions\r\nand services that are worth the money. I must say that your\r\nservice is honest and excellent. In addition to your total\r\nprofessionalism, I also admire your companies image and style.\r\nI always look forward to receiving your daily emails. I\r\nappreciate your bits of wisdom and no-nonsense approach. Some\r\ntraders may not want to hear about the personal or psychological\r\nside of trading which you sometimes write about, but it's just\r\nas, if not more important than any other aspect of trading!  The\r\ninformation, strategies, methods, and wisdom you provide are\r\nobviously based on the truth of the markets and not hype or BS!\r\nMost people don't seem to realize that trading to win is about\r\nstrategy and trade management. It's not about being right or\r\nwrong regarding price direction. It's not about the best\r\nindicator, system, or method. The only thing we have control of\r\nas traders is our decisions about trades and capital. We cannot\r\npredict or control the price line, we can only identify high\r\nprobability setups and then call and execute a play.\r\n I sometimes compare it to football. Smart coaches know the basic\r\nkeys to winning a championship are a solid running game (short\r\nconsistent swing profits) and a great defense (always, always\r\nuse stops). Winning football teams practice hard (backtest and\r\npaper trade new theories). When they're in a real game they call\r\nplays (execute trades) based on field position (price), down\r\n(time), yards-to-go (volatility), and opponent (commodity).\r\nAlthough they do have their favorite high percentage plays\r\n(patterns,indicators,systems), they don't call the same play\r\nevery time in every situation against every opponent! Winning\r\nteams know when to settle for less points and kick a field goal\r\n(never let a gain turn to a loss), and they know when to punt\r\n(scratch a trade when it's going nowhere). But most important,\r\nthey never go for it on 4th down in their own territory (violate\r\nstops). Plays don't work every time (win every trade), but some plays\r\nbreak out for a touchdown (quick windfall profit), while other\r\nplays result in a loss (happens all the time), and sometimes\r\nthey even result in a fumble/interception for a touchdown\r\n(gaps or limits)!  But in the end, if they have solid coaching\r\n(trade management skills) and use the best players to execute\r\nthe plays (broker with good fills), they will win most of their\r\ngames and have a winning season (profitable week\\month\\year).\r\nKeep up the excellent service and information. Best Regards,\r\n-David Breen Jr.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nMuch thanks to David Breen Jr. for letting us publish his\r\ncomments. I would welcome anyone to write down their words\r\nof wisdom and send them in. Our CTS \"community\" is based\r\non the credo of \"Traders Helping Traders\", and we can all\r\nimprove our successes with helpful insights driven by\r\nour experience. David & I will see you in the winners circle.\r\n\r\nN\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nKey Technical Developments (close of 06/05)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nDecember Euro's are still trading at a 30 basis point discount\r\nto September. Unless the the Fed switches to a tightening bias,\r\nthere's 30 points to be be made here without any move in September.\r\n\r\nAction in gold looks very bearish to me! Commercials sold more on\r\nthe recent decline and are now holding their largest net short\r\nsince 1996.....At -68k contracts, they sold hard into the rally!\r\nThe current price pattern appears to be a symmetrical triangle on\r\nhourly charts with a down side target near 254!\r\n\r\nThe US dollar is still acting very strong again all major currencies!\r\nAnother 100 to 150 point rally is expected near term.\r\n\r\nThe commodity rally fizzled and the CTS Power Trend rating is now in\r\nneutral territory at -3! If the energies don't get legs soon, we\r\ncould see major selling pressure across the board!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nOpportunity Alerts (Links to premium content)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe following are must see features on ctsTrader.com.

trade management It s not about being right orwrong regarding price direction It s not about the bestindicator, system, or method The only thing we have control ofas traders is our decisions about

theories When they re in a real game they callplays execute trades based on field position price , down time , yards to go volatility , and opponent commodity Although they do have their favorite high percentage plays patterns,indicators,systems , they don t call the same playevery time in every situation against every opponent Winningteams know when to settle for less points and kick a field goal never let a gain turn to a loss , and they know when to punt scratch a trade when it s going nowhere But most important,they never go for it on 4th down in their own territory violatestops Plays don t work every time win every trade , but some playsbreak out for a touchdown quick windfall profit , while otherplays result in a loss happens all the time , and sometimesthey even result in a fumble interception for a touchdown gaps or limits But in the end, if they have solid coaching trade management skills and use the best players to executethe plays broker with good fills , they will win most

We did have Productivity numbers revised down for the first\r\nquarter showing -1.2%, this was the largest change since 93'. On the technical side we had a update on the \"VIX\" index showing  21.22 down -1.61 this was still bearish but showing\r\nsigns of stabilizing. The volume today was much stronger today in the cash market. And the chip sector saw a big boost in the Nasdaq and that helped propel the high tech market. Fed\r\nfutures are now showing a 65% chance of another 1/4% rate cut at the next FOMC meeting and another 24% chance of 1/4% rate cut again in July.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here? The Wave and Fib traders were off on there timing, but they did get to the 1281.00 area today. This was viewed as the top end of the market. Some of them now\r\nare looking at a break above 1283.00 on a closing bases as bullish. This \"may\" propel to 1293.00 and then to 1298.00. All I can say is since we are long from 1267.50, GOD I HOPE THERE\r\nRIGHT!!! All this will do is lock in a higher profit on our long. What was very interesting to us today was that we had two trend change signals to go short after we took out 1275.00,\r\nand both were moved to higher levels before being cancelled all together then the system just went flat. However on the last up date at 2:30cst we did get a signal to reverse however\r\nthat was not hit. We \"think\" based on the technical and cash data that the system was calculating the last thirty min of the cash market there is a high probability factor that we have\r\nhit a top and we will be short tomorrow on the open.\r\n\r\nWe do think by no means that going to these higher levels we are on a new bull run. We are and have been for a long time a bear on the long term picture. And its just a matter of time\r\nwe \"think\" will see some ugly moves to the down side. However in the mean time \"In Rome do what the Romans do\"\r\n\r\nFor those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was\r\nintroduced to \"SYSTEM TRADING\" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back, I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I\r\nalso feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program, and that if its going to have any real long term longevity to it, (then why would\r\nanyone sell it?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.\r\n\r\nI found this section in the June edition of Futures magazine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a observation from them on tracking systems. And I quote \"ALMOST ALL\r\nSUCCESSFUL SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CONSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote.\r\nWell folks the fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us and make some $$$\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a example of a client trading two full S/P contracts for the Month of May.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                              DISCRETIONARY     REGULATED-$\r\n\r\n05/02/01 BUY     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1271.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/02/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         6,575.00\r\n05/03/01 BUY     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1262.30\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          30.87\r\n05/03/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1255.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/03/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1259.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/03/01 W/T IN    MGN DEP BY W/T                                           100,000.00\r\n05/03/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         1,700.00\r\n05/03/01 P&S     1 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         3,875.00\r\n05/04/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1266.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/04/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         3,500.00\r\n05/07/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1265.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/07/01 SELL    2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1266.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES          61.74\r\n05/07/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                              .00\r\n05/08/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1264.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/08/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                          500.00\r\n05/11/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1248.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/11/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         8,000.00\r\n05/14/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1250.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/14/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                           750.00\r\n05/17/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1292.20\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/17/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       21,100.00\r\n05/21/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1301.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/21/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         4,650.00\r\n05/22/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1310.00\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/22/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                        4,250.00\r\n05/24/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1289.80\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/24/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       10,100.00\r\n05/25/01 SELL    4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1280.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/25/01 GVP FEE   APR CME RB&H G/UP                               3.00\r\n05/25/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                         4,650.00\r\n05/31/01 BUY     4 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX           1257.50\r\n--------                                       TRNS FEES         123.48\r\n05/31/01 P&S     2 JUN 1 IOM S&P INDEX                                       11,500.00\r\n* * * * * OPEN POSITIONS * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * OPEN POSITIONS * * * * *\r\n05/31/01    2      JUN 1   IOM S&P INDEX        1257.50           50.00\r\n  IOM        2*     SETTLE    1257.40  OPEN EQUITY                 50.00*\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n         R E F C O,  I N C.

And both\r\ntechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have\r\nbeen violated regardless of where the futures are.\r\n\r\nWhat most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long\r\nas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human\r\nintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did \"today\" but\r\nwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 \"Single Stock futures\" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r\none of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will\r\nhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r\ncomputer based with there own trading programs.\r\n\r\nAgain for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r\ncontract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.\r\n\r\nCBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited\r\nStake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001\r\n\r\n - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The\r\nChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following\r\napproval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed\r\ninto law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. \"Today's\r\nannouncement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges,\" said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. \"This exciting new\r\ninitiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives\r\ntrading and risk management.\" \"The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r\nsingle-stock futures,\" said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. \"Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r\nexchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products.\" \"I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs\r\nand our members' concerns,\" said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. \"We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r\ngreat benefit to our members.\" \"Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r\nconnectivity of the futures and securities worlds,\" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. \"This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r\nefficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options.\" \"The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new\r\nproduct to our markets,\" said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. \"The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important\r\ncontributions to the success of this venture.\" The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated\r\nexchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r\nsystem. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty\r\nsaid the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate\r\ncontracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r\nselection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r\ncorporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board\r\nOptions Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r\nindexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options\r\nmarketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on\r\nindexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50Ô , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini\r\nS&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.\r\nOn November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by\r\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone who would like to chat in more detail on our CTA managed accts please dont hesitate to call me at toll free (800) 773-1713\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nJerry Jacobs\r\nC.T.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF ANYONE WHO DID NOT GET THE \"PDF\" FILE ATTACHMENT SHOWING THE THREE YEAR\r\nLONG TERM NUMBERS AND FULL CFTC DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT PLEASE E-MAIL\r\nOR CALL TOLL FREE (800) 773-1713 AND WE WILL RESEND IT RIGHT AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\r\n\r\nTHE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN\r\nCONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR\r\nBROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN\r\nFUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU\r\nWILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.\r\n\r\nUNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION.  THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A \"LIMIT MOVE\".  THE PLACEMENT OF\r\nCONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A \"STOP-LOSS\" OR \"STOP-LIMIT\" ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS\r\nMAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.\r\n\r\nA \"SPREAD\" POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE \"LONG\" OR \"SHORT\" POSITION.  THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS\r\nWELL AS FOR YOU.  THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.\r\n\r\nIN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES.  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES\r\nTO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFIT TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.  THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS AT PAGE SEVEN A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED\r\nTO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.\r\n\r\nTHIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY\r\nTRADING BEFORE YOU TRADE, INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT AT PAGE FIVE.\r\n\r\nYOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS.  TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES\r\nINCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION.  FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES\r\nMAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED.  BEFORE YOU TRADE\r\nYOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS\r\nAVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.\r\n\r\nTHIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS.

trade still open 62 0 1,240 00 No Bonds todayCommentary Today price action was a nice show of follow through from our forecast of yesterday We were able to see that the Technical chart formations confirmed what the System sawintra day Today In the face of a lot of bearish economic data out, the market pushed forward as a counter trend move We did have Productivity numbers revised down for the firstquarter showing 1 2 , this was the largest change since 93 On the technical side we had a update on the VIX index showing 21 22 down 1 61 this was still bearish but showingsigns of stabilizing The volume today was much stronger today in the cash market And the chip sector saw a big boost in the Nasdaq and that helped propel the high tech market Fedfutures are now showing a 65 chance of another 1 4 rate cut at the next FOMC meeting and another 24 chance of 1 4 rate cut again in July Where do we go from here The Wave and Fib traders were off on there timing, but they did get to the 1281 00 area today This was viewed as the top end of the market Some of them noware looking at a break above 1283 00 on a closing bases as bullish This may propel to 1293 00 and then to 1298 00 All I can say is since we are long from 1267 50, GOD I HOPE THERERIGHT All this will do is lock in a higher profit on our long What was very interesting to us today was that we had two trend change signals to go short after we took out 1275 00,and both were moved to higher levels before being cancelled all together then the system just went flat However on the last up date at 2 30cst we did get a signal to reverse howeverthat was not hit We think based on the technical and cash data that the system was calculating the last thirty min of the cash market there is a high probability factor that we havehit a top and we will be short tomorrow on the open We do think by no means that going to these higher levels we are on a new bull run We are and have been for a long time a bear on the long term picture And its just a matter of timewe think will see some ugly moves to the down side However in the mean time In Rome do what the Romans do For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I wasintroduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in 1994 00 and have never looked back, I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However Ialso feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program, and that if its going to have any real long term longevity to it, then why wouldanyone sell it The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is I found this section in the June edition of Futures magazine, go to page 52 in the middle of the page is a observation from them on tracking systems And I quote ALMOST

That's fortunate, as I am also a\r\nslave to it. I write on Word, I plan on Excel, and I mumble\r\nspeeches with PowerPoint as my crutch. So last week I went\r\nto the San Francisco sitting of the Office XP launch, not\r\njust so I could write about it, but because I have a\r\nworkingman's interest in the tools. And I have never been so\r\nbored in my life.\r\n\r\nI wasn't alone. A guy behind me actually snored. (I myself\r\nbriefly napped, but quietly.) It's just tough to get fired\r\nup about Office's changes. Except that the dancing paper\r\nclip is gone. People were excited about that.\r\n\r\nThe biggest improvements in Office are in the area of\r\ncollaboration. Document-reviewing features are improved, and\r\nthere's integration with an online groupware service,\r\nSharePoint. Also, Office now protects data against its --\r\nand Windows' -- crashes. I pity the marketing person who had\r\nto pitch that feature.\r\n\r\nIt's a good update, but it'll be a yawner to companies that\r\ndon't use the sharing features. This is not just a snipe; it\r\nrepresents a real problem for Microsoft, which gets a huge\r\nchunk of its revenue from Office upgrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Rafe Needleman, rafe-needleman@redherring.com\r\n  Editor, http://www.redherring.com\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPANIES\r\n* Microsoft\r\n  http://www.microsoft.com\r\n\r\n* Corel\r\n  http://www.corel.com\r\n\r\n* Sun's StarOffice\r\n  http://www.sun.com/staroffice/\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATED STORIES\r\n* Dueling for desktops\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=10000001&doc_id=980018098\r\n\r\n* Street Talk: No upgrades required\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=20000002&doc_id=1610017561\r\n\r\n* Catch of the Day: The outlook for Outlook\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/story_redirect.asp?layout=story_generic&doc_id=RH1860017986&channel=80000008\r\n\r\n* PC market: Window pains for Microsoft\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=20000002&doc_id=1510017551\r\n\r\n* Fish or Cut Bait: A comeback for Corel?\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=20000002&doc_id=1410017541\r\n\r\n* The PC is dragging Microsoft down\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=20000002&doc_id=570017457\r\n\r\n* Open-source office apps: Sufficiently good\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=80000008&doc_id=1910017991\r\n\r\n* Microsoft makes a big bet on .NET\r\n  http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=10000001&doc_id=1240012124\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n               A D V E R T I S E M E N T\r\n\r\nB2B the Wrong Way Costs Plenty!\r\nTrying to fit together software from different vendors costs\r\nplenty, takes years to implement, and, ultimately, leaves\r\nyou with a glued together, complex system that never\r\ndelivers on your B2B expectations.\r\nFind out how to do it right.

AMCC Demonstrates Framer-to-Fiber Very Short Reach OC-192 CWDM Link At SuperComm\u001dDemonstration Provides a Lower Cost and Lower Power Alternative to Serial 10 Gbps Long-Reach OC-192 Solutions for Distances Less Than 300 Meters   SAN DIEGO, Jun 6, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AMCC) (NASDAQ:AMCC) Wednesday announced the demonstration of a complete very short reach (VSR) OC-192 Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) link exhibited in booth No. 8460 at SuperComm 2001 in Atlanta.   The complete VSR OC-192 link is based on the utilization of AMCC's Ganges (S19202) OC-192 framer/mapper, Verrazano (S2509) Digital Wrapper/FEC transceiver device, and Blaze Network Products' Afterburner-XGSX 10 Gbps CWDM transceiver optical module, which incorporates AMCC's S7022 and S7025 PMD devices. The S2509 and Afterburner module are implemented on a reference design with an OC-192 300-pin MSA compliant I/O interface for backwards compatibility with existing 10 Gbps long-reach OC-192 solutions. This single-fiber VCSEL-based module technology is ideally suited for inter-box short-reach OC-192 connectivity in Central Offices and Data Centers.   \"This complete OC-192 link is a very compelling low cost alternative to longer-reach solutions that are less economical for distances less than 300 meters,\" said Paul Duran, AMCC's product marketing manager. \"This demonstration exemplifies AMCC's commitment to provide the most cost effective, pre-engineered solutions for our OEM customers.\"   \"Our customers do not have the time to work out the system issues related to performance and interfaces between components in the link,\" said Bill Wiedemann, Blaze Network Product's vice president of sales and marketing. \"We choose AMCC's S7022 VCSEL Driver and S7025 TIA/Post-Amp for our CWDM module because they were designed to work in concert with other AMCC components for a complete framer-to-fiber VSR OC-192 link.\"   The Blaze Afterburner-XGSX 10 Gbps CWDM module is currently in production.

AMCC Demonstrates Framer to Fiber Very Short Reach OC 192 CWDM Link At SuperComm\u001dDemonstration Provides a Lower Cost and Lower Power Alternative to Serial 10 Gbps Long Reach OC 192 Solutions for Distances Less Than 300 Meters SAN DIEGO, Jun 6, 2001 BUSINESS WIRE Applied Micro Circuits Corp AMCC NASDAQ AMCC Wednesday announced the demonstration of a complete very short reach VSR OC 192 Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing CWDM link exhibited in booth No 8460 at SuperComm 2001 in Atlanta The complete VSR OC 192 link is based on the utilization of AMCC s Ganges S19202 OC 192 framer mapper, Verrazano S2509 Digital Wrapper FEC transceiver device, and Blaze Network Products Afterburner XGSX 10 Gbps CWDM transceiver optical module, which incorporates AMCC s S7022 and S7025 PMD devices The S2509 and Afterburner module are implemented on a reference design with an OC 192 300 pin MSA compliant I O interface for backwards compatibility with existing 10 Gbps long reach OC 192 solutions This single fiber VCSEL based module technology is ideally suited for inter box short reach OC 192 connectivity in Central Offices and Data Centers This complete OC 192 link is a very compelling low cost alternative to longer reach solutions that are less economical for distances less than 300 meters, said Paul Duran, AMCC s product marketing manager This demonstration exemplifies AMCC s commitment to provide the most cost effective, pre engineered solutions for our OEM customers Our customers do not have the time to work out the system issues related to performance and interfaces between components in the link, said Bill Wiedemann, Blaze Network Product s vice president of sales and marketing We choose AMCC s S7022 VCSEL Driver and S7025 TIA Post Amp for our CWDM module because they were designed to work in concert with other AMCC components for a complete framer to fiber VSR OC 192 link The Blaze Afterburner XGSX 10 Gbps CWDM module is currently in production

Fed Governor Laurence Meyer addresses the National\r\nAssociation for Business Economics New York Chapter on the question\r\n\"What happened to the new economy?\"\r\n\r\n6:30 PM ET. ABC/Money Magazine releases its consumer confidence\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nKEY HEADLINES:\r\n\r\nBristol-Myers near $8 billion deal for DuPont unit, says report.\r\n\r\nCadbury Schweppes near $600 million purchase of Orangina.\r\n\r\nBP, Exxon, Shell selected for $18 billion China pipeline bid, says\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nGE may divest Honeywell jet unit on antitrust concern, says report.\r\n\r\nJapan PM Koizumi says US missile defense study is worthwhile.\r\n\r\nMIDEAST: Israel Press: Israel, US reach deal on settlement freeze.\r\n\r\nChina Press: US to separate WTO talks from security issues.\r\n\r\nMexico says it determines duties on US corn imports.\r\n\r\nNapster details tentative record label deal as court hearing looms.\r\n\r\nSearch is on for US navy officer after Philippine communist rebel\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nBank of England seen leaving interest rates at 5.25%.\r\n\r\nFrench budget deficit rises to $22.2 billion in April.\r\n\r\nThe STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS\r\n\r\nThe NASDAQ and S&P 500 were mixed overnight in thin trade as both\r\nmarkets are poised to consolidate some of this week's gains.\r\nTuesday's rallies were underpinned by positive earnings outlooks in a\r\nnumber of technology companies along with ideas that the worst as far\r\nas the economy goes may be behind us. Momentum indicators are turning\r\nneutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during\r\nthe first half of June are possible. Meanwhile, the Dow extended\r\nMonday's rally thereby signaling that the setback from May's high has\r\nended. A higher weekly close for the Dow would increase the odds that\r\nthis spring's rally is resuming.\r\n\r\nEuropean markets were mostly higher in overnight trading as they\r\nfollowed US equity markets higher. The UK FTSE-100 was up 14.90\r\npoints at 5937.40 while the German DAX-30 was up 2.84 points at\r\n6244.97 as of 11:00 BST.\r\n\r\nThe Nikkei closed lower overnight after early gains faded ahead of\r\nthe close. Ongoing concerns over high-technology earnings dragged the\r\nmarket back to just below where it had started the day. The Nikkei\r\ntested the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995. Momentum\r\nindicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that a\r\nshort-term bottom might be in or near. The Nikkei closed down 7.16\r\npoints to 13,174.84 overnight.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES\r\n\r\nSeptember bonds were lower overnight due to light profit taking as it\r\nconsolidates some of its recent gains following last week's trendline\r\nbreakout. While a day or two of consolidation is possible, momentum\r\nindicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices\r\ninto early-June are possible. If the rebound off last week's low\r\ncontinues, the 38% retracement level of this spring's decline\r\ncrossing at 101-15 then the 50% retracement level crossing at 102-16\r\nare potential targets later this month.\r\n\r\nThe German bond market or Bunds were higher overnight in thin trading\r\nas there is little market moving economic news scheduled for release\r\ntoday. The June Bunds were last up 0.05 at 107.15.\r\n\r\nJapanese government bonds closed lower overnight as market\r\nparticipants took profits after Tuesday's climb to a near-record\r\nhigh. The lead June 10-year JGB futures closed at 140.50 yen, down\r\n0.28, while the yield on the benchmark No. 231 June 10-year cash bond\r\nstood at 1.225%, up 0.035, as of 1510 JT.\r\n\r\nThe ENERGY MARKETS were lower in overnight trading following the\r\nrelease of this week's API data. The report showed that crude oil\r\nsupplies rose by 3.409 million barrels last week. Gasoline stocks\r\nrose by 3.161 million barrels while distillate stocks were up 4.103\r\nmillion barrels. US refineries operated at 97.1% verses 95.3% last\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil was lower overnight following the latest API data,\r\nwhich showed an increase in stocks compared with expectations for a\r\ndecline in stocks by the trade. July is trading below the 38%\r\nretracement level of this year's rally crossing at 28.26. Closes\r\nbelow last week's low at 27.55 could lead to a test of this year's\r\nuptrend line, which crosses near 27.10 later this month. Momentum\r\nindicators are bearish but nearing their respective oversold zones\r\nwarning traders to use caution as a short-term bottom might be near.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil was lower overnight due to Tuesday's bearish API\r\ninventory report, which showed a larger-than-expected increase in\r\nstocks. Overnight losses helped confirm Monday's downside reversal as\r\nthe stage is set for a test of May's reaction low crossing at 74.55\r\nlater this month. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that\r\nsideways to lower prices during the first half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas was lower overnight in response to Tuesday's\r\nbearish inventory report. Overnight losses have led to a breakout\r\nbelow this year's uptrend line, which crosses near 90 cents. Multiple\r\ncloses below the uptrend line would confirm a top and trend change\r\nhas taken place. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that\r\nsideways to lower prices near-term are still possible.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight due to spillover\r\nselling following Tuesday's key reversal down. Traders will be\r\nwatching this week's AGA inventory data for near-term direction.\r\nHowever, it does appear as though the short covering bounce off last\r\nweek's low has come to an end.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES\r\n\r\nThe September Euro was higher overnight following Tuesday's upside\r\nreversal that was triggered by rumors of central bank intervention to\r\nsupport the currency. A higher closes during the day session is\r\nneeded to confirm Tuesday's bullish reversal pattern but closes above\r\nlast week's high crossing at 85.70 are needed to temper the bearish\r\noutlook in the market. Momentum indicators are oversold and turning\r\nneutral to bullish hinting that a low may be in place.\r\n\r\nThe September British Pound plunged to a new contract low overnight\r\nsignaling the resumption of this year's decline. This week's trading\r\nrange breakout has opened the door for a test of last fall's low on\r\nthe weekly chart, which crosses at 139.52 later this month. Momentum\r\nindicators are bearish signaling lower prices during the first half\r\nof June are likely.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc was slightly higher overnight as it\r\nextended Tuesday's rebound off last week's contract lows. Closes\r\nabove this spring's downtrend line crossing near .5676 are needed to\r\nconfirm a short-term bottom has been posted. The ADX (a trend-\r\nfollowing indicator) is turning down signaling that a low is in or\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight following\r\nTuesday's key reversal up. Closes above May's high crossing at .6541\r\nare needed to confirm an upside breakout of May's trading range and\r\nrenew this spring's rally. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling\r\nthat sideways to higher prices during the first half of June are\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen was lower overnight thereby confirming\r\nTuesday's key reversal down. The yen filled last week's gap at .8425\r\nthereby increasing the odds that a short-term top has been posted.\r\nStochastics and RSI are turning bearish following a test of their\r\nrespective overbought zones warning trader's to use caution as a\r\nshort-term appears to have been posted.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS\r\n\r\nAugust comex gold was slightly higher in overnight trading following\r\nTuesday's upside reversal. August continues to consolidate around the\r\n75% retracement level of the decline off May's high, which crosses at\r\n267.20. Closes above 269.60 are needed to temper the near- term\r\nbearish outlook in August gold. If the decline continues, the\r\nreaction low crossing at 263.20 is August's next target. Stochastics\r\nand RSI are bearish but becoming oversold warning bears not to press\r\ntheir hand as a low may be near.\r\n\r\nJuly silver was higher overnight due to light short covering as it\r\ncontinues to rebound off Monday's low. Nevertheless, the door remains\r\nopen for a test of trading range support crossing at 4.31 later this\r\nmonth. Multiple closes below the lower boundary of this spring's\r\ntrading range crossing at 4.31 would open the door for a possible\r\ntest of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month. Momentum\r\nindicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term\r\nis possible.\r\n\r\nJuly copper was steady overnight. A lower close on Wednesday would\r\nbring into question whether or not this week's bounce off May's low\r\nhas come to an end. Closes below Monday's low would open the door for\r\nadditional weakness and could lead to a test of weekly support\r\ncrossing at 74.10 later this spring. It will take closes above 77.20\r\nto temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. Momentum\r\nindicators are neutral to bearish signaling that sideways to lower\r\nprices into early-June appears are still possible.\r\n\r\nGRAINS\r\n\r\nJuly corn was lower overnight as traders have shifted their focus\r\nfrom declining crop conditions due to cool/wet conditions across the\r\nMidwest and instead are focusing on extended weather forecast calling\r\nfor warmer/dryer conditions by early next week. Additional pressure\r\ncame from weather forecast for China, which are calling for increased\r\nchances for precip over the next few days, which would help alleviate\r\nsome the trades dry weather concerns. Tuesday's downside reversal\r\nsets the stage for a test of last week's gap that led to a trendline\r\nbreakout. If the gap at 1.93 1/4 is filled, it would signal a likely\r\nend to the present short covering rally. A higher close on Wednesday\r\nwould help set the stage for a possible of May's high crossing at\r\n2.11 1/2 later this month. If you can remember 1993, it was not until\r\nfall that the trade finally realized that too much moisture can cut\r\nyields. We may be facing the same situation this year meaning that it\r\ncould be some time before the market finally begins to build in a\r\nweather premium because of too much rain in the Midwest, which has\r\nlowed yield prospects. Early calls are for July corn to open 1 cent\r\nlower this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat was lower in overnight trading as it extended this week's\r\ndecline due to forecasts calling for improving weather conditions\r\nacross the plains by early next week. Additional pressure is coming\r\nfrom a pick up in harvest in southern Oklahoma. Yield reports are\r\nmixed but generally inline with pre-harvest expectations. The rising\r\nU.S. Dollar has contributed to sluggish export demand for U.S. wheat,\r\nwhich has offset lower planted acreage and expectations for a decline\r\nin ending wheat stocks. A lack of threatening weather in other wheat\r\nproducing regions of the world is also weighing on wheat prices. I\r\nwould not be surprised to see a higher close on Wednesday as the\r\nmarket consolidates some of this week's gains. However, I am bearish\r\nlonger-term and see July wheat exceeding May's low and possibly\r\ntesting long-term support crossing at 2.50 before the expiration of\r\nthe contract. Early calls are for July wheat to open steady to 1 cent\r\nlower this morning.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPEX\r\n\r\nJuly soybeans were lower in overnight trading following Tuesday's\r\npoor close. Bearish weather forecasts calling for warmer/drier\r\nconditions to move into the Midwest by early next week have offset\r\nsupport from this week's decline in crop conditions. Closes below\r\nMonday's low crossing at 4.48 3/4 would signal that the recent\r\ntrading range breakout proved to be a bull trap. Momentum indicators\r\nare still bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term\r\nare possible. Early calls for July soybeans to open 1 to 1 1/4 cents\r\nlower this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal was lower overnight due to spillover weakness from\r\nsoybeans and bearish extended weather forecast. Overnight lows tested\r\nTuesday's gap but did not fill it. July meal is at an important\r\ncrossroads. Multiple closes above the late-May high at 168 are needed\r\nto renew this spring's rally. Closes below last week's low crossing\r\nat 159.60 would increase the odds that a short-term top has been\r\nposted. Momentum indicators are neutral to bearish warning traders to\r\nremain patient and let the market point the direction of the next\r\ntrending move. Early calls are for July soybean meal to open 30 to\r\n50-cents lower this morning.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK\r\n\r\nAugust hogs closed lower on Tuesday on ideas that meat packers will\r\nreduce slaughter thereby pressuring the cash market. Additional\r\npressure came from ideas that August has become slightly overbought\r\ntechnically. However, today's mid-range close leaves the door open\r\nfor sideways trading on Wednesday. If the rally resumes, April's high\r\ncrossing at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below last week's\r\ngap at 64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top has been\r\nposted.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed slightly lower on Tuesday as traders await\r\ndirection from the cash market. The recent rally in futures appears\r\nto have priced in $76 cash bids. Momentum indicators have become very\r\noverbought warning bulls to use caution a the market might be forming\r\na broad double top with January's high.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Tuesday thereby confirming\r\nMonday's key reversal up. Today's rally also turned a number of\r\noversold momentum indicators neutral to bullish thereby increasing\r\nthe odds that last week's low might have marked a short-term bottom.\r\nCloses above May's downtrend line crossing near 62.10 are needed\r\nbefore this is confirmed.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed higher on Tuesday due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's upside reversal. Nevertheless, July remains below\r\nbroken trading range support crossing at 955. Multiple closes above\r\nthis broken support level are needed to temper the near-term bearish\r\noutlook in the market. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming\r\noversold warning bears to use caution when pressing the short side of\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as it\r\ncontinues to consolidate above last week's apparent double bottom.\r\nMomentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that\r\nadditional short covering off last week's low is possible. If the\r\ndecline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on\r\nTuesday. Additional weakness would increase the odds that the short\r\ncovering bounce off last week's low may have run its course. It will\r\ntake closes above this year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95 to\r\nconfirm that a bottom and trend change has taken place. Until then,\r\nthe overall downtrend remains intact.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTOMORROW'S MARKET PRICES TODAY\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nArmed with such information, such power, you could\r\neasily make a fortune!\r\n\r\nDo you suspect that the markets follow some pattern? \r\nThat somehow there is some order and reason to market movements?\r\n\r\nThen you'll be both intrigued and thrilled at this\r\ntremendous discovery.\r\n\r\nCALL MARKET TOPS AND\r\nBOTTOMS WITH PINPOINT ACCURACY . . .\r\n\r\nIt makes no difference what market, stocks, futures, anything.\r\nThese techniques forecast both intraday price moves and the 2-3\r\nday short-term price swings.

decline continues, the\r reaction low crossing at 263 20 is August s next target Stochastics\r and RSI are bearish but becoming oversold warning bears not to press\r their hand as a low may be near \r July silver was higher overnight due to light short covering as it\r continues to rebound off Monday s low Nevertheless, the door remains\r open for a test of trading range support crossing at 4 31 later this\r month Multiple closes below the lower boundary of this spring s\r trading range crossing at 4 31 would open the door for a possible\r test of weekly support crossing at 4 15 later this month Momentum\r indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness near term\r is possible \r July copper was steady overnight A lower close on Wednesday would\r bring into question whether or not this week s bounce off May s low\r has come to an end Closes below Monday s low would open the door for\r additional weakness and could lead to a test of weekly support\r crossing at 74 10 later this spring It will take closes above 77 20\r to temper the near term bearish outlook in the market Momentum\r indicators are neutral to bearish signaling that sideways to lower\r prices into early June appears are still possible \r GRAINS\r July corn was lower overnight as traders have shifted their focus\r from declining crop conditions due to cool wet conditions across the\r Midwest and instead are focusing on extended weather forecast calling\r for warmer dryer conditions by early next week Additional pressure\r came from weather forecast for China, which are calling for increased\r chances for precip over the next few days, which would help alleviate\r some the trades dry weather concerns Tuesday s downside reversal\r sets the stage for a test of last week s gap that led to a trendline\r breakout If the gap at 1 93 1 4 is filled, it would signal a likely\r end to the present short covering rally A higher close on Wednesday\r would help set the stage for a possible of May s high crossing at\r 2 11 1 2 later this month If you can remember 1993, it was not until\r fall that the trade finally realized that too much moisture can cut\r yields We may be facing the same situation this year meaning that it\r could be some time before the market finally begins to build in a\r weather premium because of too much rain in the Midwest, which has\r lowed yield prospects Early calls are for July corn to open 1 cent\r lower this morning \r July wheat was lower in overnight trading as it extended this week s\r decline due to forecasts calling for improving weather conditions\r across the plains by early next week Additional pressure is coming\r from a pick up in harvest in southern Oklahoma Yield reports are\r mixed but generally inline with pre harvest expectations The rising\r U S Dollar has contributed to sluggish export demand for U S wheat,\r which has offset lower planted acreage and expectations for a decline\r in ending wheat stocks A lack of threatening weather in other wheat\r producing regions of the world is also weighing on wheat prices I\r would not be surprised to see a higher close on Wednesday as the\r market consolidates some of this week s gains However, I am bearish\r longer term and see July wheat exceeding May s low and possibly\r testing long term support crossing at 2 50 before the expiration of\r the contract Early calls are for July wheat to open steady to 1 cent\r lower this morning \r SOYBEAN COMPEX\r July soybeans were lower in overnight trading following Tuesday s\r poor close Bearish weather forecasts calling for warmer drier\r conditions to move into the Midwest by early next week have offset\r support from this week s decline in crop conditions Closes below\r Monday s low crossing at 4 48 3 4 would signal that the recent\r trading range breakout proved to be a bull trap Momentum indicators\r are still bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near term\r are possible Early calls for July soybeans to open 1 to 1 1 4 cents\r lower this morning \r July soybean meal was lower overnight due to spillover weakness from\r soybeans and bearish extended weather forecast Overnight lows tested\r Tuesday s gap but did not fill it July meal is at an important\r crossroads Multiple closes above the late May high at 168 are needed\r to renew this spring s rally Closes below last week s low crossing\r at 159 60 would increase the odds that a short term top has been\r posted Momentum indicators are neutral to bearish warning traders to\r remain patient and let the market point the direction of the next\r trending move Early calls are for July soybean meal to open 30 to\r 50 cents lower this morning \r LIVESTOCK\r August hogs closed lower on Tuesday on ideas that meat packers will\r reduce slaughter thereby pressuring the cash market Additional\r pressure came from ideas that August has become slightly overbought\r technically However, today s mid range close leaves the door open\r for sideways trading on Wednesday If the rally resumes, April s high\r crossing at 65 95 is August s next target Closes below last week s\r gap at 64 00 would strongly suggest that a short term top has been\r posted \r August cattle closed slightly lower on Tuesday as traders await\r direction from the cash market The recent rally in futures appears\r to have priced in 76 cash bids Momentum indicators have become very\r overbought warning bulls to use caution a the market might be forming\r a broad double top with January s high \r FOOD FIBER July coffee closed higher on Tuesday thereby confirming\r Monday s key reversal up Today s rally also turned a number of\r oversold momentum indicators neutral to bullish thereby increasing\r the odds that last week s low might have marked a short term bottom \r Closes above May s downtrend line crossing near 62 10 are needed\r before this is confirmed \r July cocoa closed higher on Tuesday due to light short covering\r following Monday s upside reversal Nevertheless, July remains below\r broken trading range support crossing at 955 Multiple closes above\r this broken support level are needed to temper the near term bearish\r outlook in the market Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming\r oversold warning bears to use caution when pressing the short side of\r the market \r July sugar closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as it\r continues to consolidate above last week s apparent double bottom \r Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that\r additional short covering off last week s low is possible If the\r decline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets \r July cotton posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on\r Tuesday Additional weakness would increase the odds that the short\r covering bounce off last week s low may have run its course It will\r take closes above this year s downtrend line crossing near 43 95 to\r confirm that a bottom and

Fed Governor Laurence Meyer addresses the National\r\nAssociation for Business Economics New York Chapter on the question\r\n\"What happened to the new economy?\"\r\n\r\n6:30 PM ET. ABC/Money Magazine releases its consumer confidence\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nKEY HEADLINES:\r\n\r\nBristol-Myers near $8 billion deal for DuPont unit, says report.\r\n\r\nCadbury Schweppes near $600 million purchase of Orangina.\r\n\r\nBP, Exxon, Shell selected for $18 billion China pipeline bid, says\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nGE may divest Honeywell jet unit on antitrust concern, says report.\r\n\r\nJapan PM Koizumi says US missile defense study is worthwhile.\r\n\r\nMIDEAST: Israel Press: Israel, US reach deal on settlement freeze.\r\n\r\nChina Press: US to separate WTO talks from security issues.\r\n\r\nMexico says it determines duties on US corn imports.\r\n\r\nNapster details tentative record label deal as court hearing looms.\r\n\r\nSearch is on for US navy officer after Philippine communist rebel\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nBank of England seen leaving interest rates at 5.25%.\r\n\r\nFrench budget deficit rises to $22.2 billion in April.\r\n\r\nThe STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS\r\n\r\nThe NASDAQ and S&P 500 were mixed overnight in thin trade as both\r\nmarkets are poised to consolidate some of this week's gains.\r\nTuesday's rallies were underpinned by positive earnings outlooks in a\r\nnumber of technology companies along with ideas that the worst as far\r\nas the economy goes may be behind us. Momentum indicators are turning\r\nneutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during\r\nthe first half of June are possible. Meanwhile, the Dow extended\r\nMonday's rally thereby signaling that the setback from May's high has\r\nended. A higher weekly close for the Dow would increase the odds that\r\nthis spring's rally is resuming.\r\n\r\nEuropean markets were mostly higher in overnight trading as they\r\nfollowed US equity markets higher. The UK FTSE-100 was up 14.90\r\npoints at 5937.40 while the German DAX-30 was up 2.84 points at\r\n6244.97 as of 11:00 BST.\r\n\r\nThe Nikkei closed lower overnight after early gains faded ahead of\r\nthe close. Ongoing concerns over high-technology earnings dragged the\r\nmarket back to just below where it had started the day. The Nikkei\r\ntested the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995. Momentum\r\nindicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that a\r\nshort-term bottom might be in or near. The Nikkei closed down 7.16\r\npoints to 13,174.84 overnight.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES\r\n\r\nSeptember bonds were lower overnight due to light profit taking as it\r\nconsolidates some of its recent gains following last week's trendline\r\nbreakout. While a day or two of consolidation is possible, momentum\r\nindicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices\r\ninto early-June are possible. If the rebound off last week's low\r\ncontinues, the 38% retracement level of this spring's decline\r\ncrossing at 101-15 then the 50% retracement level crossing at 102-16\r\nare potential targets later this month.\r\n\r\nThe German bond market or Bunds were higher overnight in thin trading\r\nas there is little market moving economic news scheduled for release\r\ntoday. The June Bunds were last up 0.05 at 107.15.\r\n\r\nJapanese government bonds closed lower overnight as market\r\nparticipants took profits after Tuesday's climb to a near-record\r\nhigh. The lead June 10-year JGB futures closed at 140.50 yen, down\r\n0.28, while the yield on the benchmark No. 231 June 10-year cash bond\r\nstood at 1.225%, up 0.035, as of 1510 JT.\r\n\r\nThe ENERGY MARKETS were lower in overnight trading following the\r\nrelease of this week's API data. The report showed that crude oil\r\nsupplies rose by 3.409 million barrels last week. Gasoline stocks\r\nrose by 3.161 million barrels while distillate stocks were up 4.103\r\nmillion barrels. US refineries operated at 97.1% verses 95.3% last\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil was lower overnight following the latest API data,\r\nwhich showed an increase in stocks compared with expectations for a\r\ndecline in stocks by the trade. July is trading below the 38%\r\nretracement level of this year's rally crossing at 28.26. Closes\r\nbelow last week's low at 27.55 could lead to a test of this year's\r\nuptrend line, which crosses near 27.10 later this month. Momentum\r\nindicators are bearish but nearing their respective oversold zones\r\nwarning traders to use caution as a short-term bottom might be near.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil was lower overnight due to Tuesday's bearish API\r\ninventory report, which showed a larger-than-expected increase in\r\nstocks. Overnight losses helped confirm Monday's downside reversal as\r\nthe stage is set for a test of May's reaction low crossing at 74.55\r\nlater this month. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that\r\nsideways to lower prices during the first half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas was lower overnight in response to Tuesday's\r\nbearish inventory report. Overnight losses have led to a breakout\r\nbelow this year's uptrend line, which crosses near 90 cents. Multiple\r\ncloses below the uptrend line would confirm a top and trend change\r\nhas taken place. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that\r\nsideways to lower prices near-term are still possible.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight due to spillover\r\nselling following Tuesday's key reversal down. Traders will be\r\nwatching this week's AGA inventory data for near-term direction.\r\nHowever, it does appear as though the short covering bounce off last\r\nweek's low has come to an end.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES\r\n\r\nThe September Euro was higher overnight following Tuesday's upside\r\nreversal that was triggered by rumors of central bank intervention to\r\nsupport the currency. A higher closes during the day session is\r\nneeded to confirm Tuesday's bullish reversal pattern but closes above\r\nlast week's high crossing at 85.70 are needed to temper the bearish\r\noutlook in the market. Momentum indicators are oversold and turning\r\nneutral to bullish hinting that a low may be in place.\r\n\r\nThe September British Pound plunged to a new contract low overnight\r\nsignaling the resumption of this year's decline. This week's trading\r\nrange breakout has opened the door for a test of last fall's low on\r\nthe weekly chart, which crosses at 139.52 later this month. Momentum\r\nindicators are bearish signaling lower prices during the first half\r\nof June are likely.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc was slightly higher overnight as it\r\nextended Tuesday's rebound off last week's contract lows. Closes\r\nabove this spring's downtrend line crossing near .5676 are needed to\r\nconfirm a short-term bottom has been posted. The ADX (a trend-\r\nfollowing indicator) is turning down signaling that a low is in or\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight following\r\nTuesday's key reversal up. Closes above May's high crossing at .6541\r\nare needed to confirm an upside breakout of May's trading range and\r\nrenew this spring's rally. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling\r\nthat sideways to higher prices during the first half of June are\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen was lower overnight thereby confirming\r\nTuesday's key reversal down. The yen filled last week's gap at .8425\r\nthereby increasing the odds that a short-term top has been posted.\r\nStochastics and RSI are turning bearish following a test of their\r\nrespective overbought zones warning trader's to use caution as a\r\nshort-term appears to have been posted.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS\r\n\r\nAugust comex gold was slightly higher in overnight trading following\r\nTuesday's upside reversal. August continues to consolidate around the\r\n75% retracement level of the decline off May's high, which crosses at\r\n267.20. Closes above 269.60 are needed to temper the near- term\r\nbearish outlook in August gold. If the decline continues, the\r\nreaction low crossing at 263.20 is August's next target. Stochastics\r\nand RSI are bearish but becoming oversold warning bears not to press\r\ntheir hand as a low may be near.\r\n\r\nJuly silver was higher overnight due to light short covering as it\r\ncontinues to rebound off Monday's low. Nevertheless, the door remains\r\nopen for a test of trading range support crossing at 4.31 later this\r\nmonth. Multiple closes below the lower boundary of this spring's\r\ntrading range crossing at 4.31 would open the door for a possible\r\ntest of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month. Momentum\r\nindicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term\r\nis possible.\r\n\r\nJuly copper was steady overnight. A lower close on Wednesday would\r\nbring into question whether or not this week's bounce off May's low\r\nhas come to an end. Closes below Monday's low would open the door for\r\nadditional weakness and could lead to a test of weekly support\r\ncrossing at 74.10 later this spring. It will take closes above 77.20\r\nto temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. Momentum\r\nindicators are neutral to bearish signaling that sideways to lower\r\nprices into early-June appears are still possible.\r\n\r\nGRAINS\r\n\r\nJuly corn was lower overnight as traders have shifted their focus\r\nfrom declining crop conditions due to cool/wet conditions across the\r\nMidwest and instead are focusing on extended weather forecast calling\r\nfor warmer/dryer conditions by early next week. Additional pressure\r\ncame from weather forecast for China, which are calling for increased\r\nchances for precip over the next few days, which would help alleviate\r\nsome the trades dry weather concerns. Tuesday's downside reversal\r\nsets the stage for a test of last week's gap that led to a trendline\r\nbreakout. If the gap at 1.93 1/4 is filled, it would signal a likely\r\nend to the present short covering rally. A higher close on Wednesday\r\nwould help set the stage for a possible of May's high crossing at\r\n2.11 1/2 later this month. If you can remember 1993, it was not until\r\nfall that the trade finally realized that too much moisture can cut\r\nyields. We may be facing the same situation this year meaning that it\r\ncould be some time before the market finally begins to build in a\r\nweather premium because of too much rain in the Midwest, which has\r\nlowed yield prospects. Early calls are for July corn to open 1 cent\r\nlower this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat was lower in overnight trading as it extended this week's\r\ndecline due to forecasts calling for improving weather conditions\r\nacross the plains by early next week. Additional pressure is coming\r\nfrom a pick up in harvest in southern Oklahoma. Yield reports are\r\nmixed but generally inline with pre-harvest expectations. The rising\r\nU.S. Dollar has contributed to sluggish export demand for U.S. wheat,\r\nwhich has offset lower planted acreage and expectations for a decline\r\nin ending wheat stocks. A lack of threatening weather in other wheat\r\nproducing regions of the world is also weighing on wheat prices. I\r\nwould not be surprised to see a higher close on Wednesday as the\r\nmarket consolidates some of this week's gains. However, I am bearish\r\nlonger-term and see July wheat exceeding May's low and possibly\r\ntesting long-term support crossing at 2.50 before the expiration of\r\nthe contract. Early calls are for July wheat to open steady to 1 cent\r\nlower this morning.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPEX\r\n\r\nJuly soybeans were lower in overnight trading following Tuesday's\r\npoor close. Bearish weather forecasts calling for warmer/drier\r\nconditions to move into the Midwest by early next week have offset\r\nsupport from this week's decline in crop conditions. Closes below\r\nMonday's low crossing at 4.48 3/4 would signal that the recent\r\ntrading range breakout proved to be a bull trap. Momentum indicators\r\nare still bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term\r\nare possible. Early calls for July soybeans to open 1 to 1 1/4 cents\r\nlower this morning.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal was lower overnight due to spillover weakness from\r\nsoybeans and bearish extended weather forecast. Overnight lows tested\r\nTuesday's gap but did not fill it. July meal is at an important\r\ncrossroads. Multiple closes above the late-May high at 168 are needed\r\nto renew this spring's rally. Closes below last week's low crossing\r\nat 159.60 would increase the odds that a short-term top has been\r\nposted. Momentum indicators are neutral to bearish warning traders to\r\nremain patient and let the market point the direction of the next\r\ntrending move. Early calls are for July soybean meal to open 30 to\r\n50-cents lower this morning.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK\r\n\r\nAugust hogs closed lower on Tuesday on ideas that meat packers will\r\nreduce slaughter thereby pressuring the cash market. Additional\r\npressure came from ideas that August has become slightly overbought\r\ntechnically. However, today's mid-range close leaves the door open\r\nfor sideways trading on Wednesday. If the rally resumes, April's high\r\ncrossing at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below last week's\r\ngap at 64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top has been\r\nposted.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed slightly lower on Tuesday as traders await\r\ndirection from the cash market. The recent rally in futures appears\r\nto have priced in $76 cash bids. Momentum indicators have become very\r\noverbought warning bulls to use caution a the market might be forming\r\na broad double top with January's high.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Tuesday thereby confirming\r\nMonday's key reversal up. Today's rally also turned a number of\r\noversold momentum indicators neutral to bullish thereby increasing\r\nthe odds that last week's low might have marked a short-term bottom.\r\nCloses above May's downtrend line crossing near 62.10 are needed\r\nbefore this is confirmed.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa closed higher on Tuesday due to light short covering\r\nfollowing Monday's upside reversal. Nevertheless, July remains below\r\nbroken trading range support crossing at 955. Multiple closes above\r\nthis broken support level are needed to temper the near-term bearish\r\noutlook in the market. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming\r\noversold warning bears to use caution when pressing the short side of\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as it\r\ncontinues to consolidate above last week's apparent double bottom.\r\nMomentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that\r\nadditional short covering off last week's low is possible. If the\r\ndecline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on\r\nTuesday. Additional weakness would increase the odds that the short\r\ncovering bounce off last week's low may have run its course. It will\r\ntake closes above this year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95 to\r\nconfirm that a bottom and trend change has taken place. Until then,\r\nthe overall downtrend remains intact.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTOMORROW'S MARKET PRICES TODAY\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nArmed with such information, such power, you could\r\neasily make a fortune!\r\n\r\nDo you suspect that the markets follow some pattern? \r\nThat somehow there is some order and reason to market movements?\r\n\r\nThen you'll be both intrigued and thrilled at this\r\ntremendous discovery.\r\n\r\nCALL MARKET TOPS AND\r\nBOTTOMS WITH PINPOINT ACCURACY . . .\r\n\r\nIt makes no difference what market, stocks, futures, anything.\r\nThese techniques forecast both intraday price moves and the 2-3\r\nday short-term price swings.

We hoped the unique news of the company's intention to file a patent on its revenue generating technology would restore the stock to its previous high. Instead, the enhanced volume brought out sellers, and the stock dropped. This demonstrates the importance of selling quickly when these stocks we feature in Trading Alerts go against us. You should have sold the stock at $1.06 if you followed our advice, and gotten out with a small but manageable loss. It's always preferable to be out wishing you were in, rather than in wishing you were out.   In this edition we have a follow up on XML technology in the news, and coverage on Energy Power's earnings announcement which was issued yesterday.      [IMAGE] XML Global (OTC BB: XMLG) in Investor's Business Daily and Worth Magazine's Informative Article   Late last year we were contacted by an associate in the computer industry who told us we needed to find a microcap stock with leading edge technology in XML programming language. At the time we had no idea what XML was, but we learned, loved it, and found a pure play in the microcap arena to cover.   Information on the XML revolution is starting to appear in the main stream financial media. Last Thursday's edition of the Investor's Business Daily contained an article which referenced our choice, XML Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG). Many thanks to the members who emailed us concerning our typo in the weekend edition. We mistakenly printed the article was in the May 12th edition. It was actually in the May 24th edition.   It's of no consequence as we have the article available for you in its entirety. Investors Business Daily gave the company permission to post the article in PDF Format on its corporate web site. Simply click here  to go directly to it, or go XML Global's investor relations section at their web site- Click Here  for that section.    In addition to the Investor's Business Daily article, June's edition of Worth Magazine has a feature article entitled The XML Revolution. This article has an understandable explanation of XML- what it is, how it works, and how it will be used. This is a must read for anyone interested in the future of computer programming. Click Here  to read the article, or go to the following URL: http://www.worth.com/content_articles/0601_xml_revolution.html    XML Global Technologies has spent the last two years developing tools for programmers working on code for the XML revolution. We expect media attention to continue to grow in this arena, and hopefully we have identified an outstanding pure play for our members. Please read the articles and let us know if you agree. We are getting more excited as coverage of this new technology continues to accelerate.     [IMAGE] Energy Power Systems LTD (OTC BB: EYPSF) Announces 3rd Quarter Results   We believe there will be a bull market for North American energy related companies for the next two to five years. In the microcap arena, Energy Power Systems LTD is our contribution.   The company's market cap (only $18 million) leaves plenty of room for upside, and we are anticipating substantial growth in future quarters. New business will start to come out in the June and September quarters, and their M&M Subsidiary is embarking on $5.5 million in new projects right now.   On Tuesday nine month financial performance was announced by the company. Revenues were only up 9%, but the earnings turnaround was impressive. The company turned a small EBITDA profit of $100,000, but this compares to a $1.3 million loss in year 2000. This is very positive news as stocks generally trade on investor perception of the future, and this company is definitely headed in the right direction.   Here is the complete text of the press release for your review:     Tuesday June 5, 5:14 pm Eastern Time  Press Release   Energy Power Systems Limited - Announcement  TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 5, 2001--Energy Power Systems Limited (``EPS'' or the ``Company'') (NASD Bulletin Board: EYPSF) (CDNX: YPS - news; www.epsx.com) announces that it has issued unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine month period ended March 31, 2001. These statements reflect the following activities of EPS and its subsidiaries:    consolidated revenues of $15.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($13.9 million -2000); consolidated gross profits of $1.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($2.3 - 2000); consolidated EBITDA of $0.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($1.3 million negative EBITDA -2000); consolidated loss from continuing operations of $0.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($2.0 million - 2000); and consolidated basic and fully diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.13 ($.63 per share - 2000).   EPS's consolidated revenues of $15.2 million for the nine month period ending March 31, 2001 increased by 9% from the $13.9 million reported during the same period the previous year. Increased activity from the Company's Engineering and Offshore Division and new sources of revenue from the Company's Oil and Gas Division that began operations February 1, 2001 contributed to this revenue growth.    Consolidated EBITDA of $100,000 for the nine-month period ending March 31, 2001 was positive versus consolidated EBITDA of $(1.3) million reported for the previous nine-month period. The consolidated EBITDA increase was largely due to the benefits of a corporate restructuring initiated at the end of fiscal 2000 as well as the additional cash flow from the introduction of the oil and gas division. ``It was our corporate objective at the end of last year to turn the Company cash flow positive this fiscal year,'' stated Scott Hargreaves CFO, ``to achieve this we eliminated two non-core subsidiaries and created the Oil & Gas Division. We are most pleased with the positive improvement in cash flow as EBITDA increased $1.4 for the nine month period ending March 31, 2001.''    The Engineering and Offshore Division is currently working on recently announced contracts of $5.5 million of work to carry itself over the fourth quarter and beyond. Construction of the 'floating production, storage and offloading' platform for the White Rose Oil Field expected to get the go ahead late this summer could feed further growth for the Engineering and Offshore Division in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2001. In addition the Oil and Gas Division is adding positive cash flow to help fund corporate operations and future exploration and acquisition strategies. At present the Company is planning its summer exploration, drilling and development program to increase production and oil & gas reserves.    EPS is an Independent Power Project Developer, an Oil and Gas exploration company and a Contractor of infrastructure projects.    EPS issued and outstanding common shares: 5,663,419    Certain of the statements contained in this news release are forward-looking statements. While these statements reflect the Corporation's current beliefs, they are subject to uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors include, but are not limited to, the demand for the Corporation's products and services, economic and competitive conditions, access to borrowed or equity capital on favourable terms, and other risks detailed in the Corporation's Form 20-F and Annual Report.

the previous year Increased activity from the Company s Engineering and Offshore Division and new sources of revenue from the Company s Oil and Gas Division that began operations February 1, 2001 contributed to this revenue growth Consolidated EBITDA of 100,000 for the nine month period ending March 31, 2001 was positive versus consolidated EBITDA of 1 3 million reported for the previous nine month period The consolidated EBITDA increase was largely due to the benefits of a corporate restructuring initiated at the end of fiscal 2000 as well as the additional cash flow from the introduction of the oil and gas division It was our corporate objective at the end of last year to turn the Company cash flow positive this fiscal year, stated Scott Hargreaves CFO, to achieve this we eliminated two non core subsidiaries and created the Oil Gas Division We are most pleased with the positive improvement in cash flow as EBITDA increased 1 4 for the nine month period ending March 31, 2001 The Engineering and Offshore Division is currently working on recently announced contracts of 5 5 million of work to carry itself over the fourth quarter and beyond Construction of the floating production, storage and offloading platform for the White Rose Oil Field expected to get the go ahead late this summer could feed further growth for the Engineering and Offshore Division in the fiscal

We hoped the unique news of the company's intention to file a patent on its revenue generating technology would restore the stock to its previous high. Instead, the enhanced volume brought out sellers, and the stock dropped. This demonstrates the importance of selling quickly when these stocks we feature in Trading Alerts go against us. You should have sold the stock at $1.06 if you followed our advice, and gotten out with a small but manageable loss. It's always preferable to be out wishing you were in, rather than in wishing you were out.   In this edition we have a follow up on XML technology in the news, and coverage on Energy Power's earnings announcement which was issued yesterday.      [IMAGE] XML Global (OTC BB: XMLG) in Investor's Business Daily and Worth Magazine's Informative Article   Late last year we were contacted by an associate in the computer industry who told us we needed to find a microcap stock with leading edge technology in XML programming language. At the time we had no idea what XML was, but we learned, loved it, and found a pure play in the microcap arena to cover.   Information on the XML revolution is starting to appear in the main stream financial media. Last Thursday's edition of the Investor's Business Daily contained an article which referenced our choice, XML Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG). Many thanks to the members who emailed us concerning our typo in the weekend edition. We mistakenly printed the article was in the May 12th edition. It was actually in the May 24th edition.   It's of no consequence as we have the article available for you in its entirety. Investors Business Daily gave the company permission to post the article in PDF Format on its corporate web site. Simply click here  to go directly to it, or go XML Global's investor relations section at their web site- Click Here  for that section.    In addition to the Investor's Business Daily article, June's edition of Worth Magazine has a feature article entitled The XML Revolution. This article has an understandable explanation of XML- what it is, how it works, and how it will be used. This is a must read for anyone interested in the future of computer programming. Click Here  to read the article, or go to the following URL: http://www.worth.com/content_articles/0601_xml_revolution.html    XML Global Technologies has spent the last two years developing tools for programmers working on code for the XML revolution. We expect media attention to continue to grow in this arena, and hopefully we have identified an outstanding pure play for our members. Please read the articles and let us know if you agree. We are getting more excited as coverage of this new technology continues to accelerate.     [IMAGE] Energy Power Systems LTD (OTC BB: EYPSF) Announces 3rd Quarter Results   We believe there will be a bull market for North American energy related companies for the next two to five years. In the microcap arena, Energy Power Systems LTD is our contribution.   The company's market cap (only $18 million) leaves plenty of room for upside, and we are anticipating substantial growth in future quarters. New business will start to come out in the June and September quarters, and their M&M Subsidiary is embarking on $5.5 million in new projects right now.   On Tuesday nine month financial performance was announced by the company. Revenues were only up 9%, but the earnings turnaround was impressive. The company turned a small EBITDA profit of $100,000, but this compares to a $1.3 million loss in year 2000. This is very positive news as stocks generally trade on investor perception of the future, and this company is definitely headed in the right direction.   Here is the complete text of the press release for your review:     Tuesday June 5, 5:14 pm Eastern Time  Press Release   Energy Power Systems Limited - Announcement  TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 5, 2001--Energy Power Systems Limited (``EPS'' or the ``Company'') (NASD Bulletin Board: EYPSF) (CDNX: YPS - news; www.epsx.com) announces that it has issued unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine month period ended March 31, 2001. These statements reflect the following activities of EPS and its subsidiaries:    consolidated revenues of $15.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($13.9 million -2000); consolidated gross profits of $1.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($2.3 - 2000); consolidated EBITDA of $0.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($1.3 million negative EBITDA -2000); consolidated loss from continuing operations of $0.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($2.0 million - 2000); and consolidated basic and fully diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.13 ($.63 per share - 2000).   EPS's consolidated revenues of $15.2 million for the nine month period ending March 31, 2001 increased by 9% from the $13.9 million reported during the same period the previous year. Increased activity from the Company's Engineering and Offshore Division and new sources of revenue from the Company's Oil and Gas Division that began operations February 1, 2001 contributed to this revenue growth.    Consolidated EBITDA of $100,000 for the nine-month period ending March 31, 2001 was positive versus consolidated EBITDA of $(1.3) million reported for the previous nine-month period. The consolidated EBITDA increase was largely due to the benefits of a corporate restructuring initiated at the end of fiscal 2000 as well as the additional cash flow from the introduction of the oil and gas division. ``It was our corporate objective at the end of last year to turn the Company cash flow positive this fiscal year,'' stated Scott Hargreaves CFO, ``to achieve this we eliminated two non-core subsidiaries and created the Oil & Gas Division. We are most pleased with the positive improvement in cash flow as EBITDA increased $1.4 for the nine month period ending March 31, 2001.''    The Engineering and Offshore Division is currently working on recently announced contracts of $5.5 million of work to carry itself over the fourth quarter and beyond. Construction of the 'floating production, storage and offloading' platform for the White Rose Oil Field expected to get the go ahead late this summer could feed further growth for the Engineering and Offshore Division in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2001. In addition the Oil and Gas Division is adding positive cash flow to help fund corporate operations and future exploration and acquisition strategies. At present the Company is planning its summer exploration, drilling and development program to increase production and oil & gas reserves.    EPS is an Independent Power Project Developer, an Oil and Gas exploration company and a Contractor of infrastructure projects.    EPS issued and outstanding common shares: 5,663,419    Certain of the statements contained in this news release are forward-looking statements. While these statements reflect the Corporation's current beliefs, they are subject to uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors include, but are not limited to, the demand for the Corporation's products and services, economic and competitive conditions, access to borrowed or equity capital on favourable terms, and other risks detailed in the Corporation's Form 20-F and Annual Report.

Members Last week s Trading Alert on Petapeer Holdings OTC BB PETP was a failure We hoped the unique news of the company s intention to file a patent on its revenue generating technology would restore the stock to its previous high Instead, the enhanced volume brought out sellers, and the stock dropped This demonstrates the importance of selling quickly when these stocks we feature in Trading Alerts go against us You should have sold the stock at 1 06 if you followed our advice, and gotten out with a small but manageable loss It s always preferable to be out wishing you were in, rather than in wishing you were out In this edition we have a follow up on XML technology in the news, and coverage on Energy Power s earnings announcement which was issued yesterday IMAGE XML Global OTC BB XMLG in Investor s Business Daily and Worth Magazine s Informative Article Late last year we were contacted by an associate in the computer industry who told us we needed to find a microcap stock with leading edge technology in XML programming language At the time we had no idea what XML was, but we learned, loved it, and found a pure play in the microcap arena to cover Information on the XML revolution is starting to appear in the main stream financial media Last Thursday s edition of the Investor s Business Daily contained an article which referenced our choice, XML Global Technologies OTC BB XMLG Many thanks to the members who emailed us concerning our typo in the weekend edition We mistakenly printed the article was in the May 12th edition It was actually in the May 24th edition It s of no consequence as we have the article available for you in its entirety Investors Business Daily gave the company permission to post the article in PDF Format on its corporate web site Simply click here to go directly to it, or go XML Global s investor relations section at their web site Click Here for that section In addition to the Investor s Business Daily article, June s edition of Worth Magazine has a feature article entitled The XML Revolution This article has an understandable explanation of XML what it is, how it works, and how it will be used This is a must read for anyone interested in the future of computer programming Click Here to read the article, or go to the following URL http www worth com content articles 0601 xml revolution html XML Global Technologies has spent the last two years developing tools for programmers working on code for the XML revolution We expect media attention to continue to grow in this arena, and hopefully we have identified an

The calculations that our computer model was reading into the last thirty min of the cash market yesterday, was right on the marker!!!\r\nWe did infact get short on the open. Its very rare that we do have trend change orders on the open of the bell, but they do happen every sixty days or so. If we had a open above\r\n1283.90 that would of been our new entry. But we did have a slight gap down that was below that level so the computer showed the entry at the first print. We now off set our long with\r\na respectable profit and show a real sweet open short going into the close.\r\n\r\nToday in the cash market we found out that a great deal of calls were sold at the CBOE by market makers. The bias is now that the Dow from the open has a 70-100 pt upside and a max 500\r\npt down side at this time frame. As of the close we \"think\" that we may see the levels of 1266.00,1264.00,1262.00 before a bounce. \"If \" we can break 1258.00 then we have a chance to\r\n1244.00. This is the area that may show signs of a temp bottom.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here? Based on four up days in the Dow. The Market is showing signs of getting tired and as we move into the bal of the week \"we\" think that the cash market prefers\r\nnot to be long over this weekend coming up. I am leaning to seeing those first levels of support before any bullish activity, then we wait and let the market tell us where its going\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nUntil tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nJerry\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was\r\nintroduced to \"SYSTEM TRADING\" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back, I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I\r\nalso feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program, and that if its going to have any real long term longevity to it, (then why would\r\nanyone sell it?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.\r\n\r\nI found this section in the June edition of Futures magazine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a observation from them on tracking systems. And I quote \"ALMOST ALL\r\nSUCCESSFUL SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CONSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote.\r\nWell folks the fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us that has shown to make money.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market. And both\r\ntechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have\r\nbeen violated regardless of where the futures are.\r\n\r\nWhat most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long\r\nas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human\r\nintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did \"today\" but\r\nwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 \"Single Stock futures\" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r\none of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will\r\nhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r\ncomputer based with there own trading programs.\r\n\r\nAgain for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r\ncontract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.\r\n\r\nCBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited\r\nStake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001\r\n\r\n - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The\r\nChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following\r\napproval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed\r\ninto law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. \"Today's\r\nannouncement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges,\" said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. \"This exciting new\r\ninitiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives\r\ntrading and risk management.\" \"The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r\nsingle-stock futures,\" said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. \"Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r\nexchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products.\" \"I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs\r\nand our members' concerns,\" said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. \"We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r\ngreat benefit to our members.\" \"Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r\nconnectivity of the futures and securities worlds,\" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. \"This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r\nefficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options.\" \"The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new\r\nproduct to our markets,\" said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. \"The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important\r\ncontributions to the success of this venture.\" The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated\r\nexchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r\nsystem. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty\r\nsaid the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate\r\ncontracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r\nselection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r\ncorporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board\r\nOptions Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r\nindexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options\r\nmarketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on\r\nindexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50Ô , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini\r\nS&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.\r\nOn November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by\r\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone who would like to chat in more detail on our CTA managed accts please dont hesitate to call me at toll free (800) 773-1713\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nJerry Jacobs\r\nC.T.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF ANYONE WHO DID NOT GET THE \"PDF\" FILE ATTACHMENT SHOWING THE THREE YEAR\r\nLONG TERM NUMBERS AND FULL CFTC DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT PLEASE E-MAIL\r\nOR CALL TOLL FREE (800) 773-1713 AND WE WILL RESEND IT RIGHT AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\r\n\r\nTHE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL.

the last thirty min of the cash market yesterday, was right on the marker We did infact get short on the open Its very rare that we do have trend change orders on the open of the bell, but they do happen every sixty days or so If we had a open above1283 90 that would of been our new entry But we did have a slight gap down that was below that level so the computer showed the entry at the first print We now off set our long witha respectable profit and show a real sweet open short going into the close Today in the cash market we found out that a great deal of calls were sold at the CBOE by market makers The bias is now that the Dow from the open has a 70 100 pt upside and a max 500pt down side at this time frame As of the close we think that we may see the levels of 1266 00,1264 00,1262 00 before a bounce If we can break 1258 00 then we have a chance to1244 00 This is the area that may show signs of a temp bottom Where do we go from here Based on four up days in the Dow The Market is showing signs of getting tired and as we move into the bal of the week we think that the cash market prefersnot to be long over this weekend coming up I am leaning to seeing those first levels of support before any bullish activity, then we wait and let the market tell us where its goingnext Until tomorrow JerryFor those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I wasintroduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in 1994 00 and have never looked back, I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However Ialso feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program, and that if its going to have any real long term longevity to it, then why wouldanyone sell it The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is I found this section in the June edition of Futures magazine, go to page 52 in the middle of the page is a observation from them on tracking systems And I quote ALMOST ALLSUCCESSFUL SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS THE CONSISTENT SHORT TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED Un quote Well folks the fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us that has shown to make money For those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market And bothtechnical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes havebeen violated regardless of where the futures are What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity s and futures have there own platforms and there own systems Its been proven that as longas one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year Humanintervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did today butwhats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame This is the secret for long term success On the E mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8 21 2001 Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will beone of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms willhave access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12 21 2001 As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are allcomputer based with there own trading programs Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in acontract And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year For more details on this market see details below CBOE Create Joint Venture on Single Stock Futures World s Two Largest

more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame This is the secret for long term success \r On the E mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8 21 2001 Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be\r one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms will\r have access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12 21 2001 As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good \r For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all\r computer based with there own trading programs \r Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a\r contract And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year For more

willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world s center in derivatives\r trading and risk management The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for\r single stock futures, said CME Chairman Scott Gordon Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago\r exchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products I am enthused that Chicago s exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers needs\r and our members concerns, said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide\r great benefit to our members Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and\r connectivity of the futures and securities worlds, said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital\r

and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME s GLOBEXâ2 electronic trading\r system CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation OCC , which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products McNulty\r said the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC The exchanges anticipate\r contracting with Designated Primary Market Makers DPMs in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,\r selection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements Single stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and\r corporate hedging activities CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange for physicals EFPs The Chicago Board\r Options Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982 Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40\r indexes, such as the S P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq 100, and the S P 100 It remains the world s largest and most

However, it\r\nwill take closes above May's highs to renew this spring's rallies.\r\n\r\nThe Dow posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday due to\r\nlight profit taking, which was triggered by comments from\r\nHewlett-Packard that it sees continued deterioration in the global\r\neconomy and that it is cautious on its third- quarter revenue\r\nprojections. Closes above 11,350 or below 10,835.40 are needed to\r\nclear up near-term direction in the Dow. Until then, look for\r\ntwo-sided trading to continue.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES September bonds posted an inside day with a higher for\r\nthe sixth day in a row. Weakness in the equity markets underpinned\r\nSeptember bonds, which remain in a short-term uptrend following last\r\nweek's breakout above this spring's downtrend line. The door remains\r\nopen for additional gains with the 38% retracement level of this\r\nspring's decline crossing at 101-15 being September's next target.\r\nMomentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher\r\nprices are possible.\r\n\r\nThe CRB INDEX closed lower for the third day in a row but remains\r\nabove trading range support crossing at 208.43. Weakness in energies,\r\nsome foods, precious metals and cattle weighed on the CRB index. A\r\nshort covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's\r\nlosses leaving the door open for sideways to higher prices near-term.\r\nCloses below 208.43 would confirm a trading range breakout thereby\r\nopening the door for a larger-degree decline during June. Closes\r\nabove broken support crossing at 213.20 are needed to temper the\r\nbearish outlook.\r\n\r\nENERGY MARKETS closed lower on Wednesday following the release of\r\nthis week's API and DOE inventory reports. Both reports showed\r\nincreases in crude, heating oil, and gasoline stocks during the past\r\nweek. News that OPEC will keep crude oil production at current levels\r\nand will make up any short fall due to Iraq's decision to halt crude\r\noil exports weighed on energy prices. The latest AGA inventory data\r\nreport for natural gas showed that supplies increased 117 billion\r\ncubic feet during the past week.\r\n\r\nJuly crude oil posted a key reversal down on Wednesday but closed\r\nabove the 50% retracement level of the December/May rally crossing at\r\n27.51. Wednesday's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways\r\ntrading on Thursday as a number of momentum indicators have become\r\noversold hinting that a low might be in or near. Closes below today's\r\nlow could lead to an eventual test of April's low crossing at 25.90\r\nlater this month.\r\n\r\nJuly heating oil closed lower on Wednesday and posted a key reversal\r\ndown. However, a short covering bounce ahead of the close erased much\r\nof today's losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on\r\nThursday. July tested last week's low, which coincides with the 38%\r\nretracement level of the December/May rally crossing at 75.66.\r\nMultiple closes below these support levels would open the door for\r\nadditional weakness during June. Stochastics and RSI are bearish\r\nsignaling that additional weakness is possible.\r\n\r\nJuly unleaded gas plunged to new lows for the month following this\r\nweek's bearish inventory data reports and closed below this year's\r\nuptrend line and the 50% retracement level crossing at 88.93. If the\r\ndecline continues the 62% retracement level of this year's rally\r\ncrossing at 85.62 is July's next target. Stochastics and RSI are\r\nbearish signaling that additional weakness is possible.\r\n\r\nJuly Henry Hub natural gas closed lower on Wednesday following\r\ntoday's bearish AGA inventory report thereby confirming Tuesday's key\r\nreversal down. A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered\r\nsome of today's losses leaving the door open for a possible short\r\ncovering bounce on Thursday. Longer-term, the stage is set for\r\nsideways to lower prices into the end of June as seasonal weakness is\r\nlikely to continue as stocks build.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES The September Dollar posted a key reversal up on Wednesday\r\nleaving the door open for a possible test of weekly resistance\r\ncrossing at 121.50 later this month. Additional strength on Thursday\r\nis needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern. The daily ADX\r\n(a trend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that additional\r\nstrength is possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Swiss Franc posted a key reversal down on Wednesday,\r\nerasing all of this week's gains. Additional weakness on Thursday is\r\nneeded to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below last\r\nweek's low at .5564 would renew this spring's decline and set the\r\nstage for a test of weekly support crossing at .5508 later this\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nThe September Canadian Dollar closed higher on Wednesday as it broke\r\nout above trading range resistance crossing at .6541. Light profit\r\ntaking ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains leaving the\r\ndoor open for sideways trading on Thursday. Multiple closes above\r\n.6541 are needed to confirm today's breakout and resumption of this\r\nspring's rally. If the rally continues, the 62% retracement level of\r\nthis winter's decline crossing at .6573 is Sept.'s next target.\r\nMomentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher\r\nprices during the first half of June are possible.\r\n\r\nThe September Japanese Yen closed lower on Wednesday thereby\r\nconfirming yesterday's key reversal down. The mid-range close leaves\r\nthe door open for a possible short covering bounce on Thursday\r\nhowever, momentum indicators are overbought and turning bearish\r\nsignaling that a short-term top has likely been posted.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS August gold closed slightly lower on Wednesday as it\r\ncontinues to consolidate around the 75% retracement level of this\r\nspring's rally crossing at 267.20. Closes above 269.60 or below\r\n265.50 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. If\r\nthe decline resumes, the reaction low crossing at 263.20 is August's\r\nnext target.\r\n\r\nJuly silver closed slightly lower in narrow trading, as the door\r\nremains open for a test of trading range support crossing at 4.31\r\ncents. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that a trading range\r\nbreakout is possible in the near future. Closes below 4.31 would open\r\nthe door for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later\r\nthis month.\r\n\r\nJuly copper posted a downside reversal on Wednesday hinting that this\r\nweek's short covering bounce may have come to an end. However, it\r\nwill take closes below Monday's low crossing at 74.55 to renew the\r\ndecline off May's high thereby opening the door for a test of weekly\r\nsupport crossing at 74.10 later this month.\r\n\r\nGRAINS July corn posted an upside reversal on Wednesday due to\r\nexpectations that next week's crop conditions report will show\r\nfurther deterioration in the corn crop due to cool/wet conditions.\r\nExtended weather forecast are calling for warmer weather by the\r\nweekend or early next week however, additional rain is also in the\r\nforecast, which will continue to delay the last of the soybeans to be\r\nplanted. Additional gains on Thursday are needed to confirm today's\r\nbullish reversal pattern. Closes above minor resistance at $2.00 is\r\nneeded to open the door for a possible test of May's high at 2.11 1/2\r\nlater this month.\r\n\r\nJuly wheat closed higher on Wednesday due to technical short\r\ncovering. Early weakness was tied to so called harvest pressure as\r\ncombines have moved into southern Oklahoma. Early weakness tested the\r\ncontract low at 2.58 1/2 before short covering materialized.\r\nAdditional support came from spillover strength in soybeans and meal.\r\nWhile another day or two of short covering is possible, the door\r\nremains open for additional weakness during June. Closes below\r\ntoday's low would renew this spring's decline and open the door for a\r\ntest of long-term support crossing at 2.50 later this month.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed higher on Wednesday due to mixed\r\nextended weather forecast. Those forecast are calling for warmer\r\ntemps across the Midwest by the weekend however, there is also plenty\r\nof rain in the forecast, which will keep Midwest bean fields soggy\r\nand limit completion of spring planting. Additional support stemmed\r\nfrom talk of new Chinese soybean buying for August delivery. Today's\r\nnew high close for the month confirmed the recent trading range\r\nbreakout thereby opening the door for a possible test of March's high\r\ncrossing at 4.77 1/2 later this month.\r\n\r\nJuly soybean meal posted a key reversal up and closed above May's at\r\n168 to renew this spring's rally and tested the 62% retracement level\r\ncrossing at 169.40. Momentum indicators have turned bullish with\r\ntoday's gains signaling that additional short-term gains are\r\npossible. If the rally continues, fib resistance crossing at 175.40\r\nis July's next target. Basis levels remain strong due to strong\r\nforeign and domestic demand and slow producer selling of soybeans.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK August hogs closed unchanged as a short covering bounce\r\nahead of the close erased early losses. If the rally resumes, April's\r\nhigh crossing at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below last\r\nweek's gap at 64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top has\r\nbeen posted. Momentum indicators remain bullish but are entering\r\ntheir respective overbought zones warning bulls to use caution as a\r\nshort- term top might be near.\r\n\r\nAugust cattle closed lower on Wednesday and in doing so turned a\r\nnumber of momentum indicators bearish from overbought levels\r\nsignaling that a broad double top with January's high might be in\r\nplace. Today's sell off was triggered by a growing sentiment that a\r\nseasonal break is underway. Talk of sagging boxed beef and cash\r\nmarkets also weighed on prices. Some traders suggested that packers\r\nwould either have to cut kills or hold off buying large numbers of\r\ncattle in the cash market to make up for recent profit margin\r\nreductions.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee closed lower on Wednesday due in large part\r\nto a lack of short covering buying and forecasts calling for mild\r\nweather in Brazil's coffee growing region this weekend. Momentum\r\nindicators are oversold hinting that a short-term low is in place or\r\nnear. Closes above 60.80 are needed to temper the near-term bearish\r\noutlook in the market.\r\n\r\nJuly cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a lower close as it\r\nconsolidated some of this week's short covering gains. July remains\r\nbelow broken trading range support crossing at 955 leaving the door\r\nopen for sideways to lower trading if Monday's low is exceeded.\r\nHowever, momentum indicators are becoming oversold warning bears to\r\nuse caution when pressing the short side of the market.\r\n\r\nJuly sugar posted a key reversal down on Wednesday hinting that the\r\nshort covering bounce off last week's double bottom might have come\r\nto an end. Additional weakness on Thursday is needed to confirm\r\ntoday's bearish reversal pattern. Momentum indicators are bearish\r\nsignaling that a resumption of May's decline is possible. If the\r\ndecline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\r\n\r\nJuly cotton closed higher on Wednesday keeping the short covering\r\nbounce off last week's low alive for the time being.

Morgan. Trading volume was thin,\r\nwhich may have exaggerated some of today's losses. Nevertheless, both\r\nindexes posted new lows for the month thereby leaving the doors open\r\nfor additional weakness into mid-February. The NASDAQ closed down\r\n25.80 points at 1812.72 and below the 38% retracement level of the\r\nSeptember/January rally. If the decline continues, November's\r\nreaction low crossing at 1782.48 marks the next level of support. The\r\nMarch S&P 500 index also closed lower on Tuesday and below the 38%\r\nretracement level of the September/January rally crossing at 1087.97.\r\nThe door is open for a possible test of the late-October low crossing\r\nat 1060.60 later this month. March closed down 5.70 points at\r\n1083.30.\r\n\r\nThe Dow posted a quiet inside day with a lower close on Wednesday.\r\nLosses were limited as Cisco Systems rekindled investor confidence in\r\nU.S. companies with word that second- quarter results will exceed\r\ncurrent estimates. However, investors remain very nervous about\r\ncurrent stock valuations amidst suspicions over corporate accounting\r\nirregularities. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that\r\nadditional weakness is likely on Thursday that could lead to a test\r\nof last week's low crossing at 9529.40. If this support level is\r\nbroken, it would open the door for a possible test of long-term fib\r\nsupport crossing at 9318.20 later this month.\r\n\r\nINTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest\r\n\r\nMarch T-bonds posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday\r\namidst a relatively quiet session on Wall Street. Additional pressure\r\ncame from lower than expected participation of an auction of 10-year\r\nnotes. March continues to consolidate below January's high crossing\r\nat 104-11. If this resistance level is cleared, January's high\r\ncrossing at 105-06 is a potential target later this month.\r\nStochastics and a number of other short-term momentum indicators are\r\nbullish but diverging, which is often a precursor to a top and trend\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThe CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes\r\n\r\nThe CRB index posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it was\r\npressured by weakness in energies, grains, hogs, bellies and some\r\nprecious metals. Wednesday's rally was halted dead in its tracks\r\nfollowing a spike of January's downtrend line crossing near 190.50.\r\nThe CRB's failure to close above this resistance level and the\r\nprevious reaction high crossing at 190.29 is short-term bearish and\r\nleaves the door open for additional weakness for the balance of the\r\nweek. At the same time, stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish\r\nhinting that last week's low might have marked a mid-winter low.\r\n\r\nENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy\r\n\r\nThe energy markets closed lower on Tuesday following this week's\r\nbearish inventory reports and sluggish demand. Additional pressure\r\ncame from a report out of Kuwait that it will resume oil exports from\r\nits northern fields just one week after an explosion shut down one\r\nthird if its output.\r\n\r\nMarch crude oil closed lower for the third day in a row thereby\r\nincreasing the odds that last Friday's high marked the upper boundary\r\nof a late-winter trading range. Additional weakness later this week\r\nwould turn a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral to\r\nbearish thereby signaling that sideways to lower prices might be\r\npossible into mid-February. It remains unlikely that March will\r\nbreakout above the upper boundary of this winter's trading range\r\ncrossing at 22.50 in the near future.\r\n\r\nMarch heating oil closed lower on Wednesday as it extended this\r\nweek's sell off from last Friday's high. This week's bearish\r\ninventory report along with bearish extended weather forecast for the\r\nhigh-demand regions of the U.S. continues to weigh on prices. March\r\nheating oil has fallen back into January's trading range and in doing\r\nso has turned a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral to\r\nbearish. I would not be surprised to see March heating oil breakout\r\nbelow this winter's trading range as it posts a new contract low\r\nlater this month.\r\n\r\nMarch unleaded gas closed sharply lower on Wednesday retracing just\r\nover 50% of last week's rebound since Monday. Rising inventories and\r\nweak demand continue to offset the approach of seasonal trend changes\r\nin the market. Stochastics and the RSI turned bearish with today's\r\nweakness signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible during\r\nthe first half of February.\r\n\r\nMarch Henry Hub natural gas closed slightly higher due to short\r\ncovering ahead of this afternoon's AGA inventory report on Wednesday.\r\nThis afternoon's report showed a draw of 82 billion cubic feet of\r\nnatural gas taken from storage, the low end of expectations. This\r\ncould limit if not pressure prices on Thursday as the market still\r\nhas over 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas hanging over the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nCURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies\r\n\r\nThe March Dollar posted a potential downside reversal on Wednesday\r\nafter early strength tied to short covering faded into the close.\r\nHowever, the near mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways\r\ntrading on Thursday. March needs to close below Monday's low crossing\r\nat 118.96 to confirm a breakout below January's uptrend line. Until\r\nthen, I caution anyone against becoming too bearish despite the\r\noverbought condition of the market.\r\n\r\nThe March Swiss Franc remained within Tuesday's trading range but\r\nclosed higher on Wednesday due to short covering. Today's close above\r\nlast week's high crossing at .5898 increases the odds that a double\r\nbottom with December's low was posted last week. However, closes\r\nabove this winter's downtrend line crossing near .6010 are needed\r\nbefore this can be confirmed. This week's rebound has turned the\r\ndaily ADX bullish signaling that additional short covering is\r\npossible. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways\r\ntrading on Thursday. I would caution anyone from becoming too bullish\r\nthis market until this winter's downtrend line has been broken.\r\n\r\nThe March Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower on Wednesday, which\r\nled to a test of January's uptrend line crossing near .6230 and\r\ncoincides with previous support. Closes below .6230 would signal an\r\nend to this winter's short covering bounce while opening the door for\r\nsideways to lower prices into mid-February. This week's setback has\r\nturned stochastics and the RSI bearish thereby increasing the odds\r\nfor sideways to lower prices near-term.\r\n\r\nThe March Japanese Yen closed slightly higher on Wednesday as it\r\nconsolidated some of Tuesday's loss. The March yen is at a crossroads\r\nand will need to close above last fall's downtrend line crossing near\r\n.7600 or below last week's low crossing at .7416 to clear up\r\nnear-term direction in the market. If this winter's decline resumes,\r\nweekly support crossing at .7371 is March's next target.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals\r\n\r\nApril gold closed slightly lower on Wednesday amidst profit taking.\r\nEarly strength was due to spillover buying interest due to a\r\nbreakdown in investor confidence over the valuation of equity prices.\r\nHowever, a relatively quiet trading day on Wall Street triggered a\r\nround profit taking following April's break out into new contract\r\nhighs on Tuesday. Aprils could spend the balance of this week\r\nconsolidating above broken resistance crossing at 297.50. If the\r\nrally resumes later this month, weekly resistance crossing at 322 is\r\nApril's next target. Momentum indicators are bullish but becoming\r\noverbought warning bulls that a rebound in the equity markets could\r\ntrigger a round of long-liquidation as skittish investors rotate\r\ncapital out of gold and back into stocks.\r\n\r\nMarch silver posted a downside reversal on Wednesday. Overnight\r\nstrength fell just short of testing the 50% retracement level of\r\nJanuary's decline crossing at 4.492. However, a lack of panic selling\r\nin the equity markets early in the day session triggered a round of\r\nprofit taking that extended into the close. Wednesday's low-range\r\nclose leaves the door open for a steady to weaker opening for\r\nThursday. A lower close on Thursday would signal that the initial\r\nrebound off last week's low has likely come to an end.\r\n\r\nMarch copper closed lower on Wednesday as profit taking continues\r\nfollowing last week's dramatic run up. March's inability to sustain a\r\nbreakout above November's high crossing at 73.70 along with a number\r\nof short-term momentum indicators turning neutral to bearish from\r\noverbought levels hints that a broad double top might be in place.\r\nWednesday's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading\r\non Thursday as March might try to consolidate some of this week's\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nGRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains\r\n\r\nMarch corn posted a new contract low on Wednesday following reports\r\nthat Malaysia bought at least one cargo of Chinese corn for April\r\nshipment. The renewed Chinese exports combined with sluggish U.S.\r\nexports triggered another round of fund selling amidst a lack of\r\nbuying interest. A short covering bounce ahead of the close allowed\r\nMarch corn to close at long-term support crossing at 2.04 1/4. If the\r\ndecline continues, psychological support crossing at 2.00 is March's\r\nnext target later this month. Pre-report sales exports for Thursday\r\nrange from 750K to 950K metric tons, which is still well below the\r\npace needed to reach this year's export projection. Fears that the\r\nUSDA will be forced to lower its export projection possibly on Friday\r\nalso weighted on prices today. Unless the U.S. Dollar falls making\r\nU.S. corn more competitive with other feed grains on the world market\r\nand or export demand sees a significant increase in the near future,\r\ncorn prices will continue to decline until increased demand surfaces.\r\n\r\nMarch wheat posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday due\r\nto spill over weakness from corn and soybeans. It's the same old\r\nstory the bears continues to beat the strong U.S. Dollar has made\r\nU.S. wheat less competitive on the world market resulting in sluggish\r\nexport demand. Today's low-range close leaves the door open for\r\nadditional weakness on Thursday if export sales prove disappointing.\r\nDecember's low crossing at 2.77 marks the next level of support.\r\nCloses below this low could lead to an eventual test of the contract\r\nlow crossing at 2.73 later this winter. Pre-report sales estimates\r\nrange from 450K to 600K metric tons. March wheat will need to close\r\nabove January's downtrend line crossing near 2.86 to temper the\r\nnear-term bearish outlook in the market.\r\n\r\nSOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains\r\n\r\nMarch soybeans closed sharply lower on Wednesday erasing most of this\r\nweek's short covering gains. Today's sell off was triggered by a lack\r\nof fresh market friendly news, the start of harvest in Brazil and\r\nChina's unwillingness to postpone its March 20th deadline for\r\nimplementation of GMO policies regarding soybean imports. While a\r\nshort covering bounce late in the day tempered some of today's\r\nlosses, the door remains open for a likely test of last week's low in\r\nthe near future. Traders are looking for tomorrow's export sales\r\nreport to come in between 600K to 800K metric tons. While there is\r\nsome talk that the USDA might raise its export projection for this\r\nyear in Friday's report, bearish traders are quick to say that any\r\nincrease has already been factored into prices. Until March soybeans\r\ncan close above the reaction high crossing at 4.39 1/2, the February\r\nlow has not been confirmed.\r\n\r\nMarch soybean meal posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it\r\nfilled the gap crossing at 147.90 in early trading. A short covering\r\nbounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains leaving the\r\ndoor open for sideways trading on Thursday. Pre-report export sales\r\nestimates range from 75K to 140K metric tons. Today's near mid-range\r\nclose leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday however;\r\ntrading is likely to be subdued ahead of Friday's supply/demand\r\nreport. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that sideways\r\nto lower prices are possible during the first half of February.\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock\r\n\r\nApril hogs closed lower on Wednesday pressured by steady to lower\r\ncash bids and soft packer demand. Light markets tempered today's sell\r\noff as April consolidated above broken resistance crossing at 61.90.\r\nNearby cash fundamentals continue to look sloppy with a weak tone in\r\npork cutout values and shrinking packer margins. Favorable weather\r\nconditions are also a potential bearish factor. If the rally\r\ncontinues, weekly resistance, crossing at 63.60 is a potential target\r\nlater this week. At the same time, both daily and weekly stochastics\r\nare overbought hinting that a major top appears to be near. However,\r\ncloses below initial trendline support crossing near $61 are needed\r\nbefore this is confirmed.\r\n\r\nApril cattle closed higher on Wednesday and above the 75% retracement\r\nlevel of last year's decline crossing at 76.00. If the rally\r\ncontinues, the bottom of last summer's trading range crossing at\r\n77.10 is a target later this month. Today's rally was triggered by\r\nhigher boxed beef values. Cash bids have not be established however,\r\nbullish traders are hoping to see $72 bids later this week.\r\nWednesday's high-range close leaves the door open for additional\r\ngains on Thursday.\r\n\r\nFOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food\r\n\r\nMarch coffee closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to light short\r\ncovering following a gap lower opening, which was triggered by origin\r\nand fund selling. However, light trade buying after the opened\r\ntriggered a short covering bounce that lasted into the close. March\r\nis at a crossroad and needs to close above 46.20 or below 44.00 to\r\nclear up near-term direction in the market. Momentum indicators are\r\nvery oversold hinting that a short covering bounce might be needed\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nMarch cocoa posted an inside day with a higher close due to short\r\ncovering that left Tuesday's downside reversal unconfirmed. Closes\r\nabove January's high at 1422 would negate the possibility that a\r\ndouble top is forming while opening the door for a possible test of\r\nweekly resistance crossing at 1508 later this winter. Stochastics are\r\nstill bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible\r\nnear-term. March will need to close below last week's low crossing at\r\n1327 to temper the bullish outlook in the market.\r\n\r\nMay sugar closed higher on Wednesday but below mid-range. Early\r\nstrength fell short of testing broken support marked by last\r\nOctober's low crossing at 601. Until May can post multiple closes\r\nabove this broken support level thereby tempering the bearish outlook\r\nin the market, the door remains open for additional weakness later\r\nthis month and a possible test of weekly support crossing at 5.48.\r\nMomentum indicators are oversold but remain bearish signaling that\r\nadditional weakness is possible near-term.\r\n\r\nMarch cotton posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close\r\non Wednesday as the market waits for near-term direction following\r\nthe release of Thursday's export sales report. A friendly report on\r\nThursday could renew March's rally off last week's low that could\r\nlead to a test of January's high crossing at 38.50 later this month.\r\nBarring a major surprised in tomorrow's report, upside potential\r\nappears limited ahead of Friday's supply/demand report. Cotton will\r\nlikely remain range bound until the market gets a better handle on\r\nthis year's planted acreage.\r\n\r\nDaily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\r\nINO.com's end-of-day charting software for Futures, Futures\r\nOptions and Optionable Stocks. http://www.globalcharts.com\r\nSearch the INO Store  - http://store.ino.com/\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI N O   N E W S\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Nasdaq Pricing Package For Market Participants\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27784\r\nRound The Clock Trading For S&P/TOPIX 150 Index Futures\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27783\r\nCoffee 'C' Contract Maintains Record-Breaking Streak\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27782\r\nEuronext Launching Sunflower Seed Futures\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27781\r\nStrong NYMEX Statement Opposing Futures Transaction Tax\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27780\r\nFrancioni Taking Over From Fischer As SWX Chairman\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27779\r\nLondon's IPE Begins 2002 With Record Volumes\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27778\r\nOneChicago Announces First 30 Single-Stock Listings\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27777\r\nDeutsche Borse Continues To Expand European Stocks Sector\r\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27776\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nE X T R E M E   F U T U R E S\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nUpdated every 10 minutes around the clock.\r\nMore at http://quotes.ino.com/analysis/extremes/futures/\r\n\r\nWINNERS\r\n\r\nYGG2   Mini NY Gold Feb 2002                         304      12.9  +4.43\r\nNGM4   Henry Hub Natural Gas Jun 2004              2.988     0.102  +3.39\r\nLBU2   Random Length Lumber Sep 2002              286.90      8.00  +2.87\r\nPNH2   Propane Mar 2002                           0.3060    0.0085  +2.86\r\nOH2    Oats Mar 2002                             206 3/4     4 1/4  +2.10\r\nCCZ3   Cocoa Dec 2003                               1212        17  +1.42\r\nKCZ2   Coffee 'C' Dec 2002                         54.70      0.65  +1.20\r\nXLG2   Live Cattle Feb 2002                        74.60      0.88  +1.19\r\nKIJ2   Kilo Gold Apr 2002                            300       3.5  +1.18\r\nGCZ4   Gold Dec 2004                                 321       3.4  +1.07\r\n\r\nLOSERS\r\n\r\nVZU2   Corn (a/c/e) Sep 2002                         210   -15 3/4  -6.98\r\nBOH2   Soybean Oil Mar 2002                        15.25     -0.42  -2.68\r\nLHG2   Lean Hogs Feb 2002                         55.600    -1.400  -2.46\r\nHUH2   New York Harbor Unleaded Gasoline Mar 20    0.5710   -0.0142  -2.43\r\nAGM2   Silver 1,000 oz.

http quotes ino com exchanges c indexesThe CRB index posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it waspressured by weakness in energies, grains, hogs, bellies and someprecious metals Wednesday s rally was halted dead in its tracksfollowing a spike of January s downtrend line crossing near 190 50 The CRB s failure to close above this resistance level and theprevious reaction high crossing at 190 29 is short term bearish andleaves the door open for additional weakness for the balance of theweek At the same time, stochastics and the RSI have turned bullishhinting that last week s low might have marked a mid winter low ENERGY MARKETS http quotes ino com exchanges c energyThe energy markets closed lower on Tuesday following this week sbearish inventory reports and sluggish demand Additional pressurecame from a report out of Kuwait that it will resume oil exports fromits northern fields just one week after an explosion shut down onethird if its output March crude oil closed lower for the third day in a row therebyincreasing the odds that last Friday s high marked the upper boundaryof a late winter trading range Additional weakness later this weekwould turn a number of short term

bearish despite theoverbought condition of the market The March Swiss Franc remained within Tuesday s trading range butclosed higher on Wednesday due to short covering Today s close abovelast week s

caution anyone from becoming too bullishthis market until this winter s downtrend line has been broken The March Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower on Wednesday, whichled to a test of January s uptrend line crossing near 6230 andcoincides with previous support Closes below 6230 would signal anend to this winter s short covering bounce while opening the door forsideways to lower prices into mid February This week s setback hasturned stochastics and the RSI bearish thereby increasing the oddsfor sideways to lower prices near term The March Japanese Yen closed slightly higher on Wednesday as itconsolidated some of Tuesday s loss The March yen is at a crossroadsand will need to close above last fall s downtrend line crossing near 7600 or below last week s low crossing at 7416 to clear

slightly lower on Wednesday amidst profit taking Early strength was due to spillover buying interest due to abreakdown in investor confidence over the valuation of equity prices However, a relatively quiet trading day on Wall Street triggered around profit taking following April s break out into new contracthighs on Tuesday Aprils could spend the balance of this weekconsolidating above broken

Overnightstrength fell just short of testing the 50 retracement level ofJanuary s decline crossing at 4 492 However, a lack of panic sellingin the equity markets early in the day session triggered a round ofprofit taking that extended into the close Wednesday s low rangeclose leaves the door open for a steady to weaker opening forThursday A lower close on Thursday would signal that the

needed to reach this year s export projection Fears that theUSDA will be forced to lower its export projection possibly on Fridayalso weighted on prices today Unless the U S Dollar falls makingU S

the start of harvest in Brazil andChina s unwillingness to postpone its March 20th deadline forimplementation of GMO policies regarding soybean imports While ashort covering bounce late in the day tempered some of today slosses, the door remains open for a likely test of last week s low inthe near future Traders are looking for tomorrow s export salesreport to come in between 600K to 800K metric tons While there issome talk that the USDA might raise its export projection for thisyear in Friday s report, bearish traders are quick to say that anyincrease has already been factored into

Y\r \r The STOCK INDEXES http quotes ino com exchanges c indexes\r Stock indexes closed lower on Wednesday amidst heavy institutional\r selling by Goldman Sachs and J P Morgan Trading volume was thin,\r which may have exaggerated some of today s losses Nevertheless, both\r indexes posted new lows for the month thereby leaving the doors open\r for additional weakness into mid February The NASDAQ closed down\r 25 80 points at 1812 72 and below the 38 retracement level of the\r September January rally If the decline continues, November s\r reaction low crossing at 1782 48 marks the next level of support The\r March S P 500 index also closed lower on Tuesday and below the 38 \r retracement level of the September January rally crossing at 1087 97 \r The door is open for a possible test of the late October low crossing\r at 1060 60 later this month March closed down 5 70 points at\r 1083 30 \r The Dow posted a quiet inside day with a lower close on Wednesday \r Losses were limited as Cisco Systems rekindled investor confidence in\r U S companies with word that second quarter results will exceed\r current estimates However, investors remain very nervous about\r current stock valuations amidst suspicions over corporate accounting\r irregularities Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that\r additional weakness is likely on Thursday that could lead to a test\r of last week s low crossing at 9529 40 If this support level is\r broken, it would open the door for a possible test of long term fib\r support crossing at 9318 20 later this month \r INTEREST RATES http quotes ino com exchanges c interest\r March T bonds posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday\r amidst a relatively quiet session on Wall Street Additional pressure\r came from lower than expected participation of an auction of 10 year\r notes March continues to consolidate below January s high crossing\r at 104 11 If this resistance level is cleared, January s high\r crossing at 105 06 is a potential target later this month \r Stochastics and a number of other short term momentum indicators are\r bullish but diverging, which is often a precursor to a top and trend\r change \r The CRB INDEX http quotes ino com exchanges c indexes\r The CRB index posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it was\r pressured by weakness in energies, grains, hogs, bellies and some\r precious metals Wednesday s rally was halted dead in its tracks\r following a spike of January s downtrend line crossing near 190 50 \r The CRB s failure to close above this resistance level and the\r previous reaction high crossing at 190 29 is short term bearish and\r leaves the door open for additional weakness for the balance of the\r week At the same time, stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish\r hinting that last week s low might have marked a mid winter low \r ENERGY MARKETS http quotes ino com exchanges c energy\r The energy markets closed lower on Tuesday following this week s\r bearish inventory reports and sluggish demand Additional pressure\r came from a report out of Kuwait that it will resume oil exports from\r its northern fields just one week after an explosion shut down one\r third if its output \r March crude oil closed lower for the third day in a row thereby\r increasing the odds that last Friday s high marked the upper boundary\r of a late winter trading range Additional weakness later this week\r would turn a number of short term momentum indicators neutral to\r bearish thereby signaling that sideways to lower prices might be\r possible into mid February It remains unlikely that March will\r breakout above the upper boundary of this winter s trading range\r crossing at 22 50 in the near future \r March heating oil closed lower on Wednesday as it extended this\r week s sell off from last Friday s high This week s bearish\r inventory report along with bearish extended weather forecast for the\r high demand regions of the U S continues to weigh on prices March\r heating oil has fallen back into January s trading range and in doing\r so has turned a number of short term momentum indicators neutral to\r bearish I would not be surprised to see March heating oil breakout\r below this winter s trading range as it posts a new contract low\r later this month \r March unleaded gas closed sharply lower on Wednesday retracing just\r over 50 of last week s rebound since Monday Rising inventories and\r weak demand continue to offset the approach of seasonal trend changes\r in the market Stochastics and the RSI turned bearish with today s\r weakness signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible during\r the first half of February \r March Henry Hub natural gas closed slightly higher due to short\r covering ahead of this afternoon s AGA inventory report on Wednesday \r This afternoon s report showed a draw of 82 billion cubic feet of\r natural gas taken from storage, the low end of expectations This\r could limit if not pressure prices on Thursday as the market still\r has over 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas hanging over the\r market \r CURRENCIES http quotes ino com exchanges c currencies\r The March Dollar posted a potential downside reversal on Wednesday\r after early strength tied to short covering faded into the close \r However, the near mid range close leaves the door open for sideways\r trading on Thursday March needs to close below Monday s low crossing\r at 118 96 to confirm a breakout below January s uptrend line Until\r then, I caution anyone against becoming too bearish despite the\r overbought condition of the market \r The March Swiss Franc remained within Tuesday s trading range but\r closed higher on Wednesday due to short covering Today s close above\r last week s high crossing at 5898 increases the odds that a double\r bottom with December s low was posted last week However, closes\r above this winter s downtrend line crossing near 6010 are needed\r before this can be confirmed This week s rebound has turned the\r daily ADX bullish signaling that additional short covering is\r possible Today s mid range close leaves the door open for sideways\r trading on Thursday I would caution anyone from becoming too bullish\r this market until this winter s downtrend line has been broken \r The March Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower on Wednesday, which\r led to a test of January s uptrend line crossing near 6230 and\r coincides with previous support Closes below 6230 would signal an\r end to this winter s short covering bounce while opening the door for\r sideways to lower prices into mid February This week s setback has\r turned stochastics and the RSI bearish thereby increasing the odds\r for sideways to lower prices near term \r The March Japanese Yen closed slightly higher on Wednesday as it\r consolidated some of Tuesday s loss The March yen is at a crossroads\r and will need to close above last fall s downtrend line crossing near\r 7600 or below last week s low crossing at 7416 to clear up\r near term direction in the market If this winter s decline resumes,\r weekly support crossing at 7371 is March s next target \r PRECIOUS METALS http quotes ino com exchanges c metals\r April gold closed slightly lower on Wednesday amidst profit taking \r Early strength was due to spillover buying interest due to a\r breakdown in investor confidence over the valuation of equity prices \r However, a relatively quiet trading day on Wall Street triggered a\r round profit taking following April s break out into new contract\r highs on Tuesday Aprils could spend the balance of this week\r consolidating above broken resistance crossing at 297 50 If the\r rally resumes later this month, weekly resistance crossing at 322 is\r April s next target Momentum indicators are bullish but becoming\r overbought warning bulls that a rebound in the equity markets could\r trigger a round of long liquidation as skittish investors rotate\r capital out of gold and back into stocks \r March silver posted a downside reversal on Wednesday Overnight\r strength fell just short of testing the 50 retracement level of\r January s decline crossing at 4 492 However, a lack of panic selling\r in the equity markets early in the day session triggered a round of\r profit taking that extended into the close Wednesday s low range\r close leaves the door open for a steady to weaker opening for\r Thursday A lower close on Thursday would signal that the initial\r rebound off last week s low has likely come to an end \r March copper closed lower on Wednesday as profit taking continues\r following last week s dramatic run up March s inability to sustain a\r breakout above November s high crossing at 73 70 along with a number\r of short term momentum indicators turning neutral to bearish from\r overbought levels hints that a broad double top might be in place \r Wednesday s mid range close leaves the door open for sideways trading\r on Thursday as March might try to consolidate some of this week s\r losses \r GRAINS http quotes ino com exchanges c grains\r March corn posted a new contract low on Wednesday following reports\r that Malaysia bought at least one cargo of Chinese corn for April\r shipment The renewed Chinese exports combined with sluggish U S \r exports triggered another round of fund selling amidst a lack of\r buying interest A short covering bounce ahead of the close allowed\r March corn to close at long term support crossing at 2 04 1 4 If the\r decline continues, psychological support crossing at 2 00 is March s\r next target later this month Pre report sales exports for Thursday\r range from 750K to 950K metric tons, which is still well below the\r pace needed to reach this year s export projection Fears that the\r USDA will be forced to lower its export projection possibly on Friday\r also weighted on prices today Unless the U S Dollar falls making\r U S corn more competitive with other feed grains on the world market\r and or export demand sees a significant increase in the near future,\r corn prices will continue to decline until increased demand surfaces \r March wheat posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday due\r to spill over weakness from corn and soybeans It s the same old\r story the bears continues to beat the strong U S Dollar has made\r U S wheat less competitive on the world market resulting in sluggish\r export demand Today s low range close leaves the door open for\r additional weakness on Thursday if export sales prove disappointing \r December s low crossing at 2 77 marks the next level of support \r Closes below this low could lead to an eventual test of the contract\r low crossing at 2 73 later this winter Pre report sales estimates\r range from 450K to 600K metric tons March wheat will need to close\r above January s downtrend line crossing near 2 86 to temper the\r near term bearish outlook in the market \r SOYBEAN COMPLEX http quotes ino com exchanges c grains\r March soybeans closed sharply lower on Wednesday erasing most of this\r week s short covering gains Today s sell off was triggered by a lack\r of fresh market friendly news, the start of harvest in Brazil and\r China s unwillingness to postpone its March 20th deadline for\r implementation of GMO policies regarding soybean imports While a\r short covering bounce late in the day tempered some of today s\r losses, the door remains open for a likely test of last week s low in\r the near future Traders are looking for tomorrow s export sales\r report to come in between 600K to 800K metric tons While there is\r some talk that the USDA might raise its export projection for this\r year in Friday s report, bearish traders are quick to say that any\r increase has already been factored into prices Until March soybeans\r can close above the reaction high crossing at 4 39 1 2, the February\r low has not been confirmed \r March soybean meal posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it\r filled the gap crossing at 147 90 in early trading A short covering\r bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today s gains leaving the\r door open for sideways trading on Thursday Pre report export sales\r estimates range from 75K to 140K metric tons Today s near mid range\r close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday however \r trading is likely to be subdued ahead of Friday s supply demand\r report Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that sideways\r to lower prices are possible during the first half of February \r LIVESTOCK http quotes ino com exchanges c livestock\r April hogs closed lower on Wednesday pressured by steady to lower\r cash bids and soft packer demand Light markets tempered today s sell\r off as April consolidated above broken resistance crossing at 61 90 \r Nearby cash fundamentals continue to look sloppy with a weak tone in\r pork cutout values and shrinking packer margins Favorable weather\r conditions are also a potential bearish factor If the rally\r continues, weekly resistance, crossing at 63 60 is a potential target\r later this week At the same time, both daily and weekly stochastics\r are overbought hinting that a major top appears to be near However,\r closes below initial trendline support crossing near 61 are needed\r before this is confirmed \r April cattle closed higher on Wednesday and above the 75 retracement\r level of last year s decline crossing at 76 00 If the rally\r continues, the bottom of last summer s trading range crossing at\r 77 10 is a target later this month Today s rally was triggered by\r higher boxed beef values Cash bids have not be established however,\r bullish traders are hoping to see 72 bids later this week \r Wednesday s high range close leaves the door open for additional\r gains on Thursday \r FOOD FIBER http quotes ino com exchanges c food\r March coffee closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to light short\r covering following a gap lower opening, which was triggered by origin\r and fund selling However, light trade buying after the opened\r triggered a short covering bounce that lasted into the close March\r is at a crossroad and needs to close above 46 20 or below 44 00 to\r clear up near term direction in the market Momentum indicators are\r very oversold hinting that a short covering bounce might be needed\r soon \r March cocoa posted an inside day with a higher close due to short\r covering that left Tuesday s downside reversal unconfirmed Closes\r above January s high at 1422 would negate the possibility that a\r double top is forming while opening the door for a possible test of\r weekly resistance crossing at 1508 later this winter Stochastics are\r still bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible\r near term March will need to close below last week s low crossing at\r 1327 to temper the bullish outlook in the market \r May sugar closed higher on Wednesday but below mid range Early\r strength fell short of testing broken support marked by last\r October s low crossing at 601 Until May can post multiple closes\r above this broken support level thereby tempering the bearish outlook\r in the market, the door remains open for additional weakness later\r this month and a possible test of weekly support crossing at 5 48 \r Momentum indicators are oversold but remain bearish signaling that\r additional weakness is possible near term \r March cotton posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close\r on Wednesday as the market waits for near term direction following\r the release of Thursday s export sales report A friendly report on\r Thursday could renew March s rally off last week s low that could\r lead to a test of January s high crossing at 38 50 later this month \r Barring a major surprised in tomorrow s report, upside potential\r appears limited ahead of Friday s supply demand report Cotton will\r likely remain range bound until the market gets a better handle on\r this year s planted acreage \r Daily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\r INO com s end of day charting software for Futures,
