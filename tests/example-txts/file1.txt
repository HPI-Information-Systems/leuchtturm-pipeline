On Unix systems (Linux, Mac OS X, etc.), binary mode does nothing - they treat text files the same way that any other files are treated.
On Windows, however, text files are written with slightly modified line endings. 
This causes a serious problem when dealing with actual binary
files, like exe or jpg files. Therefore, when opening files which are not supposed to be text,
even in Unix, you should use wb or rb. 
Use plain w or r only for text files.
